#adhyaya(2, [The Worlds Beyond])

#speaker[Krishna] You speak as if your way is proven. But where are your devotees, Shakra? The yajnas grow thin. The soma goes unoffered. Men turn to other gods. Gentler gods. Perhaps they know something you don't.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[laughs] You think I measure truth by headcount? By who burns more ghee in my name? That is the logic of a merchant, not a king.

Let me tell you what I have seen while you played your flute in Vrindavan.

#indent-para[
I have walked in other worlds. Not the heavens. The earth, in places your Bharata does not touch. And I have seen what happens when men organize their lives around different truths.

#speaker[Krishna] Other worlds? You mean the mlecchas? What can the barbarians teach?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[sharp] This is the first disease your teaching breeds---the comfort of dismissal. "They are mlecchas, so I need not learn." Tell me, Dvarakadhisha---when Yavanas come with their phalanxes and their logic, will you dismiss them then? When Persians build fires to a single Lord of Wisdom, will you call them barbarians while they administer an empire a hundred times the size of Kuru?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quieter] Speak, then. What have you seen?

#pagebreak()
#section-heading[On the Greeks]

#speaker[Indra] West of the Sindhu, past the mountains where even your Pandavas did not walk, there is a people who live along an inland sea. They are quarrelsome. They fight amongst themselves constantly. Their cities war against their own kin.

And yet, listen to me, they have produced more clear thinking in three generations than your rishis produced in thirty.

#speaker[Krishna] Bold claim.

#speaker[Indra] There was a man among them called Aristotle. He asked: what is the purpose of a human life? Not how to escape it. Not how to transcend it. What is it #emph[for]?

#speaker[Krishna] And his answer?

#speaker[Indra] Eudaimonia. Flourishing. He said: a life is good when it fulfills its function excellently. An eye is good when it sees well. A knife is good when it cuts well. A man is good when he lives well: with courage, with justice, with practical wisdom, with proper pride.

Notice what is missing from his teaching, Keshava.

#speaker[Krishna] Detachment.

#speaker[Indra] Detachment. Liberation. Escape. He did not teach men to flee from the game---he taught them to win it. To play it beautifully. His student conquered the world from Macedon to your own Sindhu river. Twenty-five years old, weeping because there were no more lands to take.

Was that man "attached"? Yes. Was he "bound by desire"? Yes.

Was he #emph[alive]? More alive than ten thousand of your detached karma-yogis put together.

#speaker[Krishna] And he died young. His empire shattered within a generation. His generals tore each other apart for the scraps. Is that your model?

#speaker[Indra] He died #emph[complete]. He did not sit waiting for a hunter's arrow, regretting nothing because he had taught himself to want nothing. He wanted everything, and he got most of it, and when death came he met it as an equal.

That is a different kind of death than yours, Vasudeva.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[leaning forward] And those Greeks you praise so much---they built their thinking on the backs of slaves. Half their population in chains so the other half could philosophize. Their women locked away. Their own students sold in markets. Is this the excellence you want me to teach?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[unflinching] Yes, they had slaves. And your Bharata has caste. Every civilization has its sins. The question is not whether a people has darkness. The question is whether their philosophy helps them see it or helps them hide from it.

Your teaching is excellent for hiding. "It is karma. They are working out past debts. The shudra serves because he served poorly in past lives." The confusion you create is not less cruel than the chains of the Greeks. It is more cruel, because it teaches the chained man that his chains are justice.

#section-heading[On the Persians]

#speaker[Indra] Further west still, and older than the Greeks, there rose a people of fire-keepers. They worship one Lord, Ahura Mazda, they call him. The Wise Lord. And against him stands Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit.

#speaker[Krishna] Dualism. We have outgrown such things. The enlightened see that good and evil are two faces of the same...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cutting him off] Are what? Two sides of the same coin? Illusions to transcend?

This is precisely your error. The Persians understood something you refuse to accept: #emph[there are sides, and you must choose one].

#indent-para[
Not because you are ignorant. Not because you are "attached." Because #emph[choosing is what it means to be real].

Their wise men teach that every soul is a soldier in a cosmic war. That your actions matter. Not in some karmic accounting book, but because right now, in this moment, you are either feeding the light or feeding the darkness.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And who decides which is which?

#speaker[Indra] Ah, now you sound like a philosopher instead of a god. "Who decides? It's all relative. The thief thinks he's good, the saint thinks he's good."

No.

Truth, Vasudeva. Order. Creation. These are not puzzles to be dissolved through cleverness. The man who builds a well knows he has done good. The man who poisons it knows he has done evil. The confusion is performed. It is not real.

Your teaching gives men permission to perform that confusion. To say "who is the slayer, who is the slain" and feel wise while avoiding the weight of what they've done.

#section-heading[On the Arabs]

#speaker[Indra] There will come a people (I have seen it, for time is not hidden from me) who will rise from the desert with a single word on their lips. #emph[Tawhid]. Oneness. One God, one truth, one law.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[interested now] This sounds closer to what I teach. The one behind the many---

#speaker[Indra] Listen more carefully.

Their oneness is not your dissolution. When they say God is one, they do not mean "everything is God, so nothing matters." They mean: there is a standard, and you will be measured against it.

And they will have a word, #emph[jihad]. Your people will misunderstand it as mere warfare. But its root meaning is #emph[striving]. Struggle. The effort to become excellent in the path of truth.

The greater jihad, their scholars will say, is the war against your own mediocrity. The refusal to be less than you could be. Not because God needs your excellence---but because excellence is how you honor the gift of existence.

Does that sound like your teaching? "Act, but don't care about the results"? Or does it sound like something older---something closer to rta, the Vedic order that your Upanishads buried under abstractions?

#speaker[Krishna] You speak well of these desert people.

#speaker[Indra] I speak well of anyone who refuses to make peace with their own smallness.

Their mystics, the Sufis they will be called, will speak of annihilating the self in divine love. But notice #emph[how] they annihilate it. Not through calm. Through intensity. Through spinning until they collapse. Through poetry that burns. Through longing so fierce it destroys everything false.

One of them will write: #emph["I want burning, burning! Be friends with your burning."]

Does that sound like your sthitaprajna, your "man of steady wisdom"? Does that sound like equanimity?

#speaker[Krishna] There are bhaktas among my followers who love with such intensity.

#speaker[Indra] Yes. And you have never known what to do with them. They embarrass your philosophy. Mira will come, drunk on her love for you, and the pundits will say: this is not the highest path. The highest path is jnana, knowledge, the cool recognition that all is Brahman.

But Mira will be more alive than all your jnanis. And secretly, everyone will know it.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[after a long silence] You speak of peoples who burned bright and then burned out. Where are your Greeks now, Shakra? Where are your Persians? Their empires are dust while my Bharata still stands. My teaching may be gray, but gray endures.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[leaning closer] Does it? Or does it merely last? There is a difference between a civilization that lives for five thousand years and a civilization that #emph[survives] for five thousand years. One is a fire that keeps burning. The other is ash that takes a long time to scatter.

I have not finished, Govinda. Let me tell you what happens to peoples who choose survival over vitality.
