#chapter-title([Afterword:], [On the Society Indra Imagines])

What would a civilization built on these principles look like?

Not hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure without discipline. Indra does not teach that.

Not nihilism, the abandonment of meaning. Indra insists that meaning is real, that choices matter, that stakes are not illusion.

It would be a civilization that:

*Values sincerity over performance.* Where saying what you want is respected, and sophisticated evasion is seen as weakness.

*Honors ambition without apology.* Where the man who builds an empire is not told he should have sought liberation instead.

*Celebrates fierce love.* Where attachment is not a spiritual disease to be cured, but the proof of full engagement with existence.

*Embraces righteous anger.* Where the capacity to be outraged by injustice is cultivated, not stilled.

*Produces art without embarrassment.* Where beauty is recognized as a legitimate end, not a distraction from higher pursuits.

*Faces death as completion, not escape.* Where a life well-lived is measured by what it accomplished, not what it transcended.

*Welcomes joy without guilt.* Where celebration is sacred, and the philosopher who cannot dance is missing something.

This is not the only way to be human. It is one way. Indra does not claim his path is for everyone. Only that it should be available, without the hierarchy that places it below detachment.

Read the Gita. Read this. Choose.

Or better yet: read both, and build something new.
