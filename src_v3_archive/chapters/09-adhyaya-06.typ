#adhyaya(6, [On Excellence and the Fruit of Action])

#speaker[Indra] One more teaching. The most practical. The one that will shape whether your Bharata rises or falls in the ages to come.

You told Arjuna: "You have a right to action, but not to the fruits of action."#footnote[Bhagavad Gita 2.47: _Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana._]

#speaker[Krishna] This is the heart of karma yoga.

#speaker[Indra] This is the heart of mediocrity.

Listen to me carefully.

A man sets out to build a temple. If he follows your teaching, he says: "I will labor, but I will not be attached to whether the temple is built or not. My dharma is the action, not the outcome."

Now tell me: will that man check his measurements twice? Will he argue with the architect when the design is flawed? Will he argue with the king who wants it cheaper? Will he stay late into the night correcting errors? Will he fight for the temple's perfection?

#speaker[Krishna] If he is wise, he will do his duty without...

#speaker[Indra] He will do his duty. The minimum. What is required. Because anything more would be #emph[attachment to outcome]. Anything more would be desire for fruit.

But the man who #emph[wants] the temple to be magnificent? Who cares whether it stands for a thousand years? Who checks his measurements obsessively, not because it is his duty, but because the thought of a flaw #emph[pains] him?

That man will build a temple that lasts.

Excellence requires attachment. Excellence requires caring about the fruit. Excellence requires the willingness to be destroyed by failure. Not to stand above it, serene, but to let it gut you.

The Greeks built the Parthenon because they wanted glory. Not duty. Glory. The thing you dismiss as ego-attachment.

And the Parthenon still stands.

#section-heading[On What You Actually Meant]

#speaker[Krishna] You misread me, Shakra. You misread the teaching.

#speaker[Indra] Then clarify.

#speaker[Krishna] The teaching was never about numbness. It was about #emph[flow]. The archer who thinks about the prize while aiming misses the target. The coder who worries about the deadline while debugging makes more errors. The athlete who watches the scoreboard instead of the ball loses the game.

I taught focus so intense that the self disappears into the action. Not indifference to outcome, but absorption so complete that the outcome becomes inevitable.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[slowly] Then your teaching, properly understood, is about the state where the archer becomes the arrow. The state where obsession with the score ruins your aim, so you let go of the score and #emph[become] the game.

#speaker[Krishna] Yes.

#speaker[Indra] But that is not what your followers heard. They heard "don't desire" and became numb. They stopped caring about the target altogether. They confused the means with the end.

#speaker[Krishna] That is their failure, not mine.

#speaker[Indra] Is it? When an Olympian wakes at four in the morning to train, does she want the gold medal or not? When a coder enters the hackathon, when a gamer faces the final boss, when an archer aims---the wanting is what puts them in the arena. The flow-state comes during the action, but the #emph[wanting] brings them to the starting line.

You were teaching flow. But you made wanting itself suspect. And a man who is ashamed of his wanting never reaches the arena where flow is possible.

#section-heading[On the Warrior Spirit]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[attempting a counter] Your Greeks also fell. Your Romans fell. All empires of ambition and glory fall.

#speaker[Indra] Yes. And while they stood, they #emph[stood]. They made things that will be remembered when your Kali Yuga has ground all memory to dust.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[leaning forward] The Parthenon still stands, but where are the Athenians? They burned bright and burned out. My teaching produces civilizations that endure. Is three centuries of glory worth three millennia of absence?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[meeting his gaze] Is three millennia of survival worth anything if, for most of it, you are merely persisting? Waiting? Enduring without creating?

Let me ask you: would you rather have a civilization that burns bright for three centuries and leaves behind philosophy, architecture, poetry, law, or one that persists in gray mediocrity for a thousand years, everyone performing their dharma, no one reaching too high, no one risking failure?

#speaker[Krishna] That is not the choice.

#speaker[Indra] It is exactly the choice. And your teaching pushes toward the second.

Not because you intend it. But because when you tell people that ambition is attachment, that desire for greatness is ego, that the wise man cares nothing for success or failure---you remove the fuel.

The fuel is not holy. But it is necessary.

#section-heading[On Righteous Anger]

#speaker[Indra] And let me tell you something else about the fuel.

Anger.

You teach that anger is a vrtti, a fluctuation of the mind to be stilled. The wise man does not let anger move him. He acts from duty, not from passion.

But some of the greatest things ever built were built in anger. Some of the worst injustices were corrected by men and women who #emph[refused] to let their anger pass like a cloud.

When the Arabs speak of jihad as striving, they understand this. The struggle against your own mediocrity is fueled by a holy dissatisfaction, an anger at the gap between what you are and what you could be.

The Jews have a concept, #emph[tikkun olam], repairing the world.#footnote[Hebrew: literally "repair of the world." A concept in Judaism about humanity's shared responsibility to heal and transform the world.] It requires looking at the world's brokenness and being #emph[angry] that it is broken. Not equanimous. Not serene. Angry enough to fix it.

Your sthitaprajna, watching injustice with equanimity, waiting for karma to sort it out, he is not enlightened. He is complicit. And the man who sees garbage in the street and says "It is not my karma to clean this"---he is performing your teaching exactly as you taught it.

#speaker[Krishna] Anger clouds judgment. History is full of...

#speaker[Indra] History is full of anger misused. Also history is full of anger well-used. The question is not whether to feel anger but whether to aim it rightly.

A bow can kill an innocent child or slay a demon. You do not solve this by destroying the bow. You solve it by training the archer.

Your teaching destroys the bow.

#section-heading[On Suffering for Purpose]

#speaker[Indra] One final thing on this matter.

The ages to come will tell your children to avoid "toxic productivity." To prioritize "mental health" above all. To be kind to themselves, to rest, to find balance.

And this is not wrong. For the many. For those who need rest, rest is medicine.

But what of the builder who cannot sleep until the temple is perfect? What of the poet who starves to finish the verse? What of the scientist who forgets to eat because the problem has seized her mind?

Your teaching, misapplied, tells them: you are attached. You are suffering unnecessarily. Be serene. Find equanimity.

And their fire goes out.

#indent-para[
Sometimes, Govinda, greatness requires suffering. The Gita was never meant to be a manual for "stress management." It was meant to be a manual for pain management in the service of a higher goal.

But when you made all desire suspect, you made all voluntary suffering suspect too. And a people who cannot suffer for a purpose will never build anything that requires sacrifice.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And a people who suffer without wisdom will destroy themselves.

#speaker[Indra] Then teach them to suffer wisely. Not to avoid suffering. To choose suffering that matters.

Don't seek peace, Govinda. Seek a purpose worth suffering for.
