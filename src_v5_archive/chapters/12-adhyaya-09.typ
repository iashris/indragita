#adhyaya(9, [On Power and the Responsibility of the Strong])

#speaker[Indra] One final teaching. One I suspect you will resist.

Let us speak of power.

You were a king, Keshava. An advisor to kings. You moved armies, made alliances, broke them when necessary. You understood power.

But your teaching does not honor power. It treats power as a burden, a karmic obligation to be discharged without attachment. The ideal king in your philosophy is not one who revels in his capacity to shape the world, but one who rules dutifully, waiting for liberation.

#speaker[Krishna] Power corrupts. This is observable.

#speaker[Indra] Power corrupts when it is held shamefully. When the powerful man is taught that his power is spiritually suspect, that he should be embarrassed by his strength, his power goes underground. It becomes manipulation instead of command. Scheming instead of ruling.

A man who owns his power can be held accountable for it. A man who pretends he has no power, who says "I am merely an instrument of dharma," is far more dangerous.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly] You speak of power as if I do not understand it.

I have been a king, Shakra. I have watched men die on my orders. I have made alliances that required betraying people who trusted me. I have done what needed to be done.

#action[He looked at his hands.]

Do you think I do not know what power costs?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[quieter] I think you know. And I think that knowledge made you teach others to fear power, so they would not have to carry what you carried.

#action[A long silence. The wind shifted, carrying the smell of ash from Dvaraka.]

But the world does not become kinder because we fear power. It becomes a place where the ones who still want power, without your conscience, without your hesitation, take it all.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[very quietly] I know that too.

#section-heading[On Fire and Engine]

#speaker[Indra] Let me be clear about what I am asking for.

I am not asking you to unleash chaos. A fire without a hearth burns the house down.

But a hearth without fire is just cold stone.

#indent-para[
Fire without Engine, raw vitality, pure hunger, burns itself out. This is the warlord who conquers and cannot rule, the artist who creates one masterpiece and destroys himself, the lover who loves so hard he cannot function.

Engine without Fire, pure structure, empty discipline, stagnates. This is your administrator-king who preserves what was built but cannot build. Your philosopher who explains the world but cannot change it. Your civilization that survives but does not live.

What I want is Fire inside the Engine. The hunger of the outsider combined with the discipline of the builder. The vitality of the barbarian wielded with the precision of the emperor.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And you think my teaching prevents this?

#speaker[Indra] I think your teaching makes men ashamed of the fire. And a man who is ashamed of his own hunger will never build an engine worthy of it.

#section-heading[On the Vratya Emperor]

#speaker[Indra] Let me show you what Fire inside Engine looks like on your own soil.

Chandragupta Maurya.

#speaker[Krishna] You spoke of him before.

#speaker[Indra] I will speak of him again, because he is the answer to your objection. You say power corrupts. You say hunger destroys. Look at Chandragupta.

#indent-para[
He was born in the mud. A Vratya, no caste, no claim, no place in your Vedic order. By your philosophy, he should have accepted his station. Worked out his karmic debt. Waited for a better birth.

Instead, he burned.

He found Chanakya, a Brahmin who understood that philosophy without power is poetry. Together, they did what should have been impossible. They overthrew the Nandas. They pushed back Alexander's successors. They built an empire from sea to sea.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And then?

#speaker[Indra] And then, and this is the part your philosophers never mention, he #emph[ruled] it. Not as a tyrant drunk on conquest. As a king who built roads, irrigated fields, standardized measures. The fire that conquered also #emph[organized].

Fire inside Engine.

His grandson Ashoka will be remembered as the renouncer, the man who turned away from war. But Ashoka's renunciation was only possible because Chandragupta's hunger had built something worth renouncing.

#speaker[Krishna] You are saying ambition can serve order?

#speaker[Indra] I am saying ambition #emph[creates] the order that later becomes worth preserving. The philosopher who inherits a kingdom did not build it. The philosopher who builds a kingdom from nothing, #emph[he] understands that power is not a burden. It is a responsibility.

And a man who is ashamed of his power will never wield it responsibly. He will hide it. Manipulate with it. Deny that he has it while using it constantly.

The honest king says: "I am strong, and with strength comes the duty to protect the weak."

The dishonest sage says: "Power is maya. I am merely an instrument." And then he manipulates anyway, but without accountability.

Which would you rather have ruling your Bharata?

#section-heading[On Clean Roads and Two Kinds of Excellence]

#speaker[Indra] There are two kinds of cleanliness, Govinda.

The first is the priest's purity. Defensive. Fear-based. "Don't touch me, I might be polluted. Don't let the wrong person enter, they might contaminate the temple. Keep the low ones low, the high ones high, the order undisturbed."

The second is the king's excellence. Offensive. Pride-based. "This is my domain and it will be perfect. Not because I fear pollution, but because I demand that what is mine reflects what I am."

#indent-para[
The first kind of cleanliness produces caste. Untouchability. A culture where no one will clean the gutter because cleaning is polluting.

The second kind of cleanliness produces empires. Cities that shine. Roads that last a thousand years.

Your teaching, misapplied, produced the first. I want the second.
]

#speaker[Krishna] You want greatness. But greatness requires...

#speaker[Indra] Greatness requires men who want their domain to be perfect because it is #emph[theirs]. Not because dharma requires it. Not because karma will punish neglect. Because pride, the thing you call ego, cannot bear imperfection in what it has claimed.

#section-heading[On What Is Coming]

#speaker[Indra] Let me tell you what I have seen.

#action[Indra's eyes went distant. He did not share the vision, only described it.]

Men from the mountains and the desert will ride into your temples. They will not come to philosophize. They will come to take.

And your Brahmins will stand in the doorways and say: "It is karma. It is the will of the cosmos. Perhaps we are paying debts from past lives."

And they will philosophize their defeat instead of fighting it. They will be so busy explaining WHY they lost that they will forget to win.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] You have seen this?

#speaker[Indra] I have seen it. Multiple waves. Multiple centuries. And each time, the same response: acceptance dressed as wisdom.

#action[His voice hardened.]

But I have also seen the exceptions. The ones who said "No." Who fought, and sometimes lost, but fought.

Chandragupta against the Greeks. The Rajputs who held the passes. And there will be others.

In ages to come, when your Bharata groans under foreign rule, a boy in Maharashtra will look at the forts and think: "These should be mine."

Shivaji. Another Vratya in spirit, if not in birth. He will take on an empire with guerrilla tactics, mountain forts, a navy built from nothing. And when he wins, he will not loot and leave. He will build a kingdom.

Fire inside Engine. The hunger of the outsider wielded with the precision of the emperor.

Your philosophers will not know what to make of him. He does not fit the renunciate ideal. But your people will love him. Because they will recognize: this is what we could be, if we stopped being ashamed of power.

#indent-para[
#emph[Those] are my children, Govinda. The ones your philosophy could not quiet. The ones who wanted their land, their temples, their children's future, and were not ashamed to say so.
]

#action[The sea pulled at the shore. A bird cried somewhere in the distance.]

#speaker[Indra] I have seen what happens to peoples who lose the will to power. They become wise. And then they become weak. And then they become enslaved. And then they become forgotten.

Your teaching produces kings who go through the motions. Who rule because their birth requires it, not because they burn to build something. Who administer rather than create.

And administration, Vasudeva, is not enough. Administration preserves. It does not transform.

The ages to come will require transformation. Your Bharata will face peoples who want things, land, trade, dominance, and your philosopher-kings will be helpless against them. Because the peoples who want things will out-work, out-fight, and out-build the peoples who have been taught that wanting is attachment.

This is not a prediction. This is a certainty.

I have seen it.
