#adhyaya(7, [On Death, Beauty, and the Shape of a Life])

#speaker[Indra] We have spoken of life. Now let us speak of death.

You taught Arjuna that death is nothing, a change of clothes, a passage, a return to the eternal. The warrior need not fear death because the self cannot die.

#speaker[Krishna] This is true.

#speaker[Indra] And what kind of death does this teaching produce?

I will tell you. It produces deaths that are accepted rather than met. Surrendered to rather than wrestled. Your people will go gently, too gently, into a darkness they have been trained to see as illusion.

Let me speak first of Bhishma.

#section-heading[On the Beautiful Death]

On his bed of arrows, choosing the moment of his death. #emph[Iccha-mrityu], they called it. Death by will.

#speaker[Krishna] He was a great man.

#speaker[Indra] He was a man who understood that death is not something that happens #emph[to] you. It is something you can #emph[do]. Your teaching makes death a release, a shedding, a passive passage. Bhishma made it a statement.

He could have died when the first arrow struck. Most men would. Instead, he lay there for days, the arrows holding him above the earth, teaching. Waiting for the sun's northern course. Composing his exit as a poet composes a final verse.

That is not acceptance. That is authorship. Bhishma composed his death as a warrior composes his final battle. He died wanting. He died teaching. He died #emph[on his terms].

Other peoples knew this too. The Greeks called it #emph[kalos thanatos], the beautiful death.#footnote[Greek: _kalos_ (beautiful) + _thanatos_ (death). The concept of dying nobly, with one's life's work complete.] A death that completes a life rather than merely ending it. Socrates drinking the hemlock while still teaching. The Spartans at Thermopylae.

But this is not foreign to Bharata. Bhishma knew it. Your tradition forgot it when the philosophers made equanimity the only virtue.

#speaker[Krishna] And you think this is superior? Men clinging to glory even as they die?

#speaker[Indra] I think it is more honest.

When the Stoics faced death, those Romans who inherited Greek wisdom, they did not say "death is illusion." They said: "Death is real, and I will meet it as I have tried to live, with courage, with dignity, with my accounts in order."

Marcus Aurelius, an emperor, wrote in his private journal: "Do not act as if you had ten thousand years to live. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good."

#emph[While you live]. Because this is what matters. Not the eternal atman, unchanged by death. This life. This body. This brief window of consciousness in which you can make choices.

#speaker[Krishna] And when the window closes?

#speaker[Indra] Then it closes. And the question becomes: what did you do with it?

#section-heading[On How I Will Die]

#speaker[Indra] You will wait for Jara's arrow in equanimity. You will die as you taught, without attachment, without resistance, passing into whatever comes next with the serenity of one who knew it was all maya anyway.

I will die differently, when my time comes.

#action[For a moment, something flickered behind Indra's eyes, a glimpse of a future even he could not fully see.]

I do not know when. I do not know how. But I know #emph[how] I will face it.

#indent-para[
I will die wanting. I will die with unfinished projects and unfulfilled desires and things I still meant to do. And my dying will not be a release. It will be a tearing.

I will rage, Govinda. Not against the dying of the light, that is inevitable, but against the notion that I should go quietly. That equanimity is the highest way to meet the void.
]

#action[His voice dropped, almost to a whisper.]

My last thought will not be "All is Brahman." It will be "I was here. I wanted. I fought. I made things. I loved things. And I am being torn from them."

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] That sounds like suffering.

#speaker[Indra] It sounds like having lived.

This is not inferior. This is the price of having engaged. And perhaps, perhaps, the universe respects the one who does not go quietly more than the one who accepts the darkness as a friend.

#section-heading[On Making Beautiful Things]

#speaker[Indra] And while we live, Keshava, while we have bodies and time, there is the matter of beauty.

Your philosophy dismisses aesthetics. Art is maya. Music is distraction. The beautiful temple is no different from the pile of rubble it will become. All is Brahman, so why does the form matter?

But form matters. The shape of things matters.

And your own ancestors knew this. The Vedic hymns are not just meaning. They are #emph[sound]. The meters matter. The cadences matter. The rishis who composed them were not just philosophers; they were artists.

Beauty is not a distraction from truth. Beauty is truth rendered sensible. When you make something beautiful, you are participating in rta, the cosmic order, the pattern that holds existence together.

A man who dismisses beauty because "it's all illusion anyway" has missed something essential. He has failed to notice that illusion, if it is illusion, is suspiciously well-designed.

#section-heading[On the Beauty Your Priests Forgot]

#speaker[Indra] And the strangest beauty I have seen, Govinda: not in your temples with their gold and their rules, but in the forest at midnight.

#action[A vision opened. Drums. Torchlight. A figure in a demon mask, body slick with sweat, moving in ways no waking man should move.]

#speaker[Indra] #stage[narrating] The Daiva#footnote[Daiva: Spirit-worship traditions of coastal Karnataka and Kerala, where local deities possess human performers. Predates Brahmanical Hinduism and preserves older ecstatic practices.] dancer has entered the trance. The drums are matching his heartbeat, or his heartbeat is matching the drums, it is no longer clear. The god is descending.

The villagers are not watching a performance. They are witnessing a possession. When the dancer speaks, it is not his voice. When he points at a man in the crowd and names his secret sin, it is not theatre.

#action[The vision sharpened. A woman kneeling before the possessed dancer, weeping. The dancer-god placing a hand on her head.]

This is closer to what the Vedas meant than anything happening in your purified temples. This raw encounter with the divine. This joy that does not ask permission. This terror that is also ecstasy.

#action[The vision faded. The beach returned.]

Your priests call this "tamasic." Low culture. Pollution. But when the god descends into a human body and speaks, #emph[that] is the Rigvedic spirit. The folk remembered what the philosophers forgot: that the sacred is not always pure. That the gods drink blood as well as milk. That ecstasy is as holy as equanimity.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly] I have seen such things. In Vrindavan, before I became... this.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[soft] I know. And then you grew up, went to Mathura, gave discourses on transcendence, and told them that growing up meant leaving that behind.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] I gave them exactly what they could receive at that moment. The flute was the teaching they were ready for. The philosophy came later, for those who were ready. Should I have withheld both?

#speaker[Indra] You should have stayed. Or you should have never danced. But to dance, and then to leave, and then to say "the dancing was the lower path"... that is cruelty with a philosophical excuse.

The gopis did not want transcendence, Keshava. They wanted #emph[you]. The boy with the peacock feather. The one who danced.

#action[A long silence. The sea was very loud. Somewhere in the forest behind them, a peacock called, once, twice, and then was silent.]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[very quietly] Perhaps I did not know how to give them both.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[after a pause] Perhaps none of us do. But we should try. The fire and the form. The ecstasy and the structure. The dance and the teaching that honors the dance.

Not one above the other. Both. Together.

#action[He looked at Krishna, really looked, not as adversary but as someone who might understand.]

That would be a teaching worth dying for.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[meeting his gaze] Perhaps. Or perhaps worth #emph[living] for.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[almost smiling] Yes. That too.
