#adhyaya(5, [On Love, Loss, and the Nature of Consciousness])

#speaker[Indra] Now I will speak of what angers me most.

#speaker[Krishna] Anger is...

#speaker[Indra] Yes, yes. Anger is a modification of the mind. It arises from attachment to outcome. The wise man lets it pass like a cloud.

I do not want to let it pass.

#indent-para[
I want to tell you about love.

Your devotees love you. Radha loved you, or so the songs will say. And how did you love her in return?
]

#speaker[Krishna] With divine love. Beyond mortal attachment. The love that sees the eternal in...

#speaker[Indra] You left her.

#action[The accusation hung in the salt air. Krishna did not respond. His hands, resting on his knees, were very still.]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[steadily] I loved Radha as the infinite loves the finite, knowing the finite must be released to find its own truth. Had I stayed, she would have clung to the form and missed the essence. I was showing her the path beyond attachment.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cold] And so you taught her, and through her all your devotees, that being left is a spiritual teaching. That the one who stays is "attached" and the one who leaves is "liberated." You made abandonment holy.

You danced with her. You played the flute. You let her fall in love with you, not with Brahman, not with the Infinite, but with Krishna, the boy with the peacock feather. And then you told her: "What you loved was an illusion. I am beyond this form."

You seduced her and then lectured her for being seduced.

#speaker[Krishna] I had duties. Mathura called. The Yadavas needed...

#speaker[Indra] You left her.

And when you loved your son, Pradyumna, did you love him as a father? Or as a soul recognizing another soul temporarily housed in your family, soon to move on, attachment to be transcended?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[long silence] ...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[softer now] Your silence tells me what I need to know.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[very quietly] I remember her face. I remember what it cost to turn away.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[softer still] Then why did you teach others to turn away so easily?

#action[A long pause. The waves continued their ancient rhythm. Neither spoke.]

#section-heading[On Those Who Loved Without Hedge]

#speaker[Indra] Your own tradition knows this love, Govinda. Before your philosophers made it suspect.

Savitri followed Yama into the land of the dead. She did not say "death is illusion, why grieve?" She said: "I want my husband back. I will argue with Death himself until I win."

And she won. Not through transcendence. Through #emph[wanting].

Shakuntala waited for Dushyanta through the curse, through the years, through the forgetting. She did not achieve equanimity about his absence. She #emph[burned] for him. And when the ring surfaced and he remembered, the reunion was not "two atmans recognizing their essential unity." It was two people finally touching after being torn apart.

#speaker[Krishna] These are stories. Metaphors for...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[interrupting] They are stories your people told because they #emph[knew]. Before your philosophers explained the knowing away.

Other peoples have known this too. The Greeks wrote of eros. The Sufis will write poetry about love that kills. They understand what you tried to transcend.

But this teaching is not foreign, Govinda. It was yours before it was theirs.

#section-heading[On Fierce Attachment]

#speaker[Indra] The teaching at the core of all of it is: #emph[you can lose what you love, and that is why love matters].

The risk is not a flaw. The risk is the point. When I love knowing that I can lose, I love fully. When I love while telling myself "this is all maya, the soul is eternal, loss is illusion", I have hedged. I have protected myself. And in protecting myself, I have made my love smaller.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[rising, with force] You would have people suffer? Attachment brings suffering. This is observable. The mother who loses her child...

But let me ask you something, Shakra. What happens to love without wisdom? I have seen it. The lover who cannot let go becomes a stalker. The parent who loves fiercely raises a child who cannot breathe. The patriot whose love of nation becomes hatred of the other.

Love without detachment becomes possession. Possession becomes control. Control becomes destruction of the very thing you claim to love. I have watched men kill what they loved because they could not bear to see it free.

My teaching was never "do not love." It was "love, but do not strangle." Hold with open hands. The bird that stays because you left the cage open loves you. The bird that stays because you clipped its wings is a prisoner.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[after a pause] That is the first thing you have said that I cannot simply dismiss.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[sitting back down] Then hear me fully. I never taught numbness. I taught the love that can survive loss. The love that does not require the beloved to be present to remain love. Radha still loves me. I still love her. The separation did not end the love. It purified it.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[quietly] And did you ask her if she wanted purification? Or did you decide for her what was best?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[long silence] ...

#speaker[Indra] Your silence tells me what I need to know. But I grant you this: love without wisdom is dangerous. Yet wisdom without love is dead. The question is which direction the error falls.

Should she suffer? Yes. Her suffering is not a mistake. It is the proof that her love was real.

What you offer is a hedge fund for the soul. "Diversify your attachments. Keep twenty percent in transcendence. That way, when the market crashes, you'll survive."

And people take your insurance. And their loves become tepid. Their families become arrangements. Their friendships become networks. Always a part held back. Always the teaching whispering: don't commit fully, you'll only be hurt.

But the man who bet everything on love, he might lose everything. And he will have #emph[lived].

A Sufi will write: #emph["Whoever knows the power of the dance dwells in God, because he knows that love kills."]

Love kills. Not "love gently releases you from the illusion of separate selfhood." KILLS.

That is the real teaching. To love so completely that if the beloved is torn from you, part of you dies.

And your philosophy calls this bondage. I call it being alive.

#section-heading[On the Nature of Love]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly] You speak of love as if it were simple. But what #emph[is] love, Shakra? Is it not just chemistry? Neurons firing? An evolutionary trick to ensure reproduction?

#speaker[Indra] Now you sound like the materialists of future ages. Let me tell you what love actually is.

We are consciousness. You, me, the cowherds you protected, the ants beneath this tree, all of us are consciousness experiencing itself through different forms. Machines of awareness, if you will.

And love is what happens when one consciousness machine recognizes another and says: #emph[I want to resonate with you. I want to know you. I want our frequencies to align.]

#action[For a moment, the argument dropped away. Indra's voice carried something older than debate, something that sounded almost like awe.]

This is not metaphor. This is the deepest physics of existence. Consciousness seeks consciousness. Awareness reaches toward awareness. The universe is not dead matter occasionally producing mind. It is mind occasionally condensing into matter.

And when two minds find each other, truly find each other, something is created that neither could create alone. A harmony. A new pattern in the fabric of existence.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly] That is... not what the Vedanta teaches.

#speaker[Indra] The Vedanta teaches that you are Brahman dreaming. I am telling you that Brahman #emph[wants]. That the dreaming itself is a form of desire. That consciousness seeks resonance as fire seeks fuel.

And when two minds find each other, truly find each other, something is created that neither could create alone.

#speaker[Krishna] And when they lose each other?

#speaker[Indra] Then the pattern tears. And it should hurt. The pain is information. It tells you: something real was here, and now it's gone.

Your teaching tries to make the pain disappear by denying the reality of the connection. "It was maya. The self is eternal. Nothing was really lost."

But something WAS lost. A unique resonance. An unrepeatable harmony. And a philosophy that cannot grieve cannot truly love.

#section-heading[On the Many Forms of Love]

#speaker[Indra] And Keshava, this resonance takes many forms.

The Greeks loved men and women both. Sappho wrote of women loving women with a fire that burned through centuries. Achilles and Patroclus: the poets cannot decide if they were friends or lovers, because in the Greek understanding the distinction barely mattered. Love was love. Resonance was resonance.

#speaker[Krishna] My people have known this too. The third nature. Shikhandi. The tales speak of...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[interrupting] Your tales speak of it, and then your pundits bury it. They say: this was a special case. An exception. A past-life complication.

But Shikhandi was no exception. Shikhandi, fluid and boundary-crossing, was the instrument that brought down Bhishma. The old order cannot be defeated by the old weapons. It takes the one who doesn't fit to break what has become too rigid.

#speaker[Krishna] Shikhandi was... complicated. The texts are unclear whether...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[interrupting] The texts are unclear because the texts were written by those who fit the mold. They did not know what to do with one who didn't.

But Shikhandi knew. And Bhishma, the old, rigid, perfect Bhishma, could not raise his bow against the one who refused to be categorized.

#indent-para[
The Vratyas, the wanderers your priests called "impure", they understood. The one who doesn't fit the mold is not a mistake. They are the mutation that allows the species to evolve. They are the crack through which new light enters.
]

Consciousness does not care what body it wears when it reaches toward another consciousness. The machine of awareness has no gender until it is embodied. And even then, the yearning for resonance does not check the body's configuration before it strikes.

A man who loves a man is not confused. He has simply found the consciousness that harmonizes with his own. A woman who loves a woman is not aberrant. She has simply found her frequency.

Your teaching, when misapplied, makes people ashamed of these resonances. It tells them: this is attachment, this is maya, this is a distraction from the true goal of liberation.

But liberation that requires you to deny love is not liberation. It is amputation.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] I never taught that love between...

#speaker[Indra] You taught that all love is a lesser path. That bhakti is for those not ready for jnana. That attachment of any kind is bondage.

And your followers heard this and made hierarchies. This love is acceptable, that love is perverse. This attachment is devotion, that attachment is sin.

The teaching that all is one became the justification for excluding those whose oneness looked different.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[meeting his eyes] Then what would you have me teach about love?

#speaker[Indra] That it is worth the wound. That the risk is the offering. That a heart broken by real love is more whole than a heart that never dared.

I am not asking you to change your philosophy. I am asking you to see what it enables when small men wield it. And I am asking you to remember Radha.

What she felt was not illusion. What she lost was not maya. And the teaching that told her otherwise?

That teaching was not wisdom. It was cruelty with a philosophical excuse.

#action[A long silence. The waves spoke their ancient language.]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[very quietly] I remember her face when I left. I have remembered it for a hundred years.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[also quiet] I know. That is why I can speak to you at all. A man who had truly transcended would not remember.

#action[They sat with that for a moment. Two old gods. Both carrying things.]

#speaker[Indra] #stage[finally] Shall I speak of other things? Or do you need silence?

#speaker[Krishna] Speak. The arrow is not here yet.
