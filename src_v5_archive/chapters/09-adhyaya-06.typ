#adhyaya(6, [On Excellence and the Fruit of Action])

#speaker[Indra] One more teaching. The most practical. The one that will shape whether your Bharata rises or falls in the ages to come.

You told Arjuna: "You have a right to action, but not to the fruits of action."#footnote[Bhagavad Gita 2.47: _Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana._]

#speaker[Krishna] This is the heart of karma yoga.

#speaker[Indra] This is the heart of mediocrity.

Listen to me carefully.

A man sets out to build a temple. Not any temple, Brihadeshwara. The great temple of Thanjavur.

If he follows your teaching, he says: "I will labor, but I will not be attached to whether the temple rises or not. My dharma is the action, not the outcome."

Now tell me: will that man obsess over the mathematics of the vimana? Will he argue with the king who wants it smaller, cheaper, faster? Will he refuse to lay a single stone until the proportions are perfect?

#speaker[Krishna] If he is wise, he will do his duty without...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cutting him off] He will do his duty. The minimum. What dharma requires. Because anything more would be #emph[attachment to outcome].

But the architects of Brihadeshwara #emph[wanted] the dome to float. They wanted visitors to gasp. They wanted their names carved where the gods could read them. And because they wanted, the temple stands a thousand years later.

#speaker[Krishna] The Parthenon also stands.

#speaker[Indra] Yes. The Greeks wanted glory too. But I am showing you: this is not foreign. Rajendra Chola wanted his temple to terrify his enemies and awe his descendants. That wanting was not ego. It was #emph[prana], the life force that builds.

Excellence requires attachment. Excellence requires caring about the fruit. Excellence requires the willingness to be destroyed by failure. Not to stand above it, serene, but to let it gut you.

The man who #emph[wants] the temple to be magnificent? Who cares whether it stands for a thousand years? Who checks his measurements obsessively, not because it is his duty, but because the thought of a flaw #emph[pains] him?

That man will build a temple that lasts.

#section-heading[On Your Own Heroes]

#speaker[Indra] Look at your own warriors, Govinda.

Arjuna after your teaching: he fights, yes. He kills Bhishma, Drona, Karna. But you know how he fights. With the equanimity you taught him. "I am not the killer. Time is the killer. These men are already dead."

Now look at Bhima.

#action[Something shifted in Indra's voice. Admiration, perhaps.]

Your teaching never fully took in him. When he killed Dushasana, he #emph[drank his blood]. He did not say "I am merely an instrument of dharma." He said: "I vowed I would do this, and I am #emph[glad]."

#speaker[Krishna] Bhima's rage was a flaw. The blood-drinking was...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[interrupting] The blood-drinking was #emph[honest]. Bhima wanted Dushasana dead. Not because cosmic justice required it. Because Dushasana had humiliated Draupadi, and Bhima loved her.

Which one truly won the war, Govinda? The one who fought as if it didn't matter? Or the one who fought as if it mattered utterly?

Your philosophy says Bhima's way was bondage. I say it was excellence. Because excellence requires caring enough to drink your enemy's blood.

#section-heading[On What You Actually Meant]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[standing, pacing] You misread me, Shakra. You misread the teaching.

#speaker[Indra] Then clarify.

#speaker[Krishna] The teaching was never about numbness. It was about #emph[flow].

#action[Krishna's voice changed. For a moment, he was not the philosopher-god. He was remembering.]

When I lifted Govardhana, I did not think about whether my arms would tire. I did not calculate whether I was attached to saving the cowherds. There was only the mountain, the rain, and the people underneath.

The score, the success or failure, disappeared. There was only the action.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[slowly] Then your teaching, properly understood, is about the state where the archer becomes the arrow.

#speaker[Krishna] Yes.

#speaker[Indra] But that is not what your followers heard. They heard "don't desire" and became numb. They confused the finger pointing at the moon for the moon itself.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] Perhaps I pointed badly.

#action[A beat of silence. Indra looked at him with something almost like compassion.]

#speaker[Indra] Perhaps. Or perhaps the teaching is too subtle for civilization. What works for a god lifting a mountain does not work for a clerk in a counting-house. He needs the cruder fuel.

When the architects of Ellora carved temples #emph[into] the mountain, not onto it...

When a young Shivaji looked at the forts of Maharashtra and thought "these should be mine"...

The wanting was what put them at the starting line. The flow came during the action. But without the wanting, they would never have started.

And in ages to come, when a coder enters the hackathon, when a gamer faces the final boss, when an archer draws at the Olympics, it will be the same. The wanting brings them. The flow sustains them. Your teaching makes the wanting itself suspect.

#section-heading[On the Warrior Spirit]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[attempting a counter] Your Greeks also fell. Your Romans fell. All empires of ambition and glory fall.

#speaker[Indra] Yes. And while they stood, they #emph[stood]. They made things that will be remembered when your Kali Yuga has ground all memory to dust.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[leaning forward] The Parthenon still stands, but where are the Athenians? They burned bright and burned out. My teaching produces civilizations that endure. Is three centuries of glory worth three millennia of absence?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[meeting his gaze] Is three millennia of survival worth anything if, for most of it, you are merely persisting? Waiting? Enduring without creating?

Let me ask you: would you rather have a civilization that burns bright for three centuries and leaves behind philosophy, architecture, poetry, law, or one that persists in gray mediocrity for a thousand years, everyone performing their dharma, no one reaching too high, no one risking failure?

#speaker[Krishna] That is not the choice.

#speaker[Indra] It is exactly the choice. And your teaching pushes toward the second.

Not because you intend it. But because when you tell people that ambition is attachment, that desire for greatness is ego, that the wise man cares nothing for success or failure, you remove the fuel.

The fuel is not holy. But it is necessary.

#section-heading[On Righteous Anger]

#speaker[Indra] And let me tell you something else about the fuel.

Anger.

You teach that anger is a vrtti, a fluctuation of the mind to be stilled. The wise man does not let anger move him. He acts from duty, not from passion.

But some of the greatest things ever built were built in anger. Some of the worst injustices were corrected by men and women who #emph[refused] to let their anger pass like a cloud.

The Jews have a concept, #emph[tikkun olam], repairing the world.#footnote[Hebrew: literally "repair of the world." A concept in Judaism about humanity's shared responsibility to heal and transform the world.] It requires looking at the world's brokenness and being #emph[angry] that it is broken. Not equanimous. Not serene. Angry enough to fix it.

Your sthitaprajna, watching injustice with equanimity, waiting for karma to sort it out, he is not enlightened. He is complicit. And the man who sees garbage in the street and says "It is not my karma to clean this", he is performing your teaching exactly as you taught it.

#speaker[Krishna] Anger clouds judgment. History is full of...

#speaker[Indra] History is full of anger misused. Also history is full of anger well-used. The question is not whether to feel anger but whether to aim it rightly.

A bow can kill an innocent child or slay a demon. You do not solve this by destroying the bow. You solve it by training the archer.

Your teaching destroys the bow.

#section-heading[On Suffering for Purpose]

#speaker[Indra] One final thing on this matter.

The ages to come will tell your children to avoid "toxic productivity." To prioritize "mental health" above all. To be kind to themselves, to rest, to find balance.

And this is not wrong. For the many. For those who need rest, rest is medicine.

But what of the builder who cannot sleep until the temple is perfect? What of the poet who starves to finish the verse? What of the scientist who forgets to eat because the problem has seized her mind?

#action[Indra's voice softened. He was looking at something far away.]

I see them, Govinda. The coder who stays until midnight because the bug offends her sense of order. The entrepreneur who risks everything because the vision will not let him rest. The artist who destroys canvas after canvas because "almost right" is unbearable.

I see the student who reads until her eyes burn because she #emph[must] understand. She doesn't know why it matters so much. Her parents tell her to rest. Her friends say she's obsessed.

But there is something in her that will not stop. The same thing that burned in me when I faced Vritra. The same thing that burned in Chandragupta when everyone said the Nandas were too strong.

Your philosophy whispers to her: "This is attachment. This is ego. Find peace."

#action[Indra turned to face Krishna directly.]

And some of them listen. And their fire goes out. And the world loses what they might have built.

I have seen this, Govinda. I have seen the unbuilt temples. The unwritten verses. The problems that remained unsolved because someone told a bright child that wanting too much was spiritually immature.

#emph[That] is the cost of your teaching. Not the saints it creates. The geniuses it extinguishes.

#indent-para[
Sometimes, Govinda, greatness requires suffering. The Gita was never meant to be a manual for "stress management." It was meant to be a manual for pain management in the service of a higher goal.

But when you made all desire suspect, you made all voluntary suffering suspect too. And a people who cannot suffer for a purpose will never build anything that requires sacrifice.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And a people who suffer without wisdom will destroy themselves.

#speaker[Indra] Then teach them to suffer wisely. Not to avoid suffering. To choose suffering that matters.

Don't seek peace, Govinda. Seek a purpose worth suffering for.
