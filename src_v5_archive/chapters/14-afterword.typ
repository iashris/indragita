#chapter-title([Afterword:], [On the Society Indra Imagines])

The conversation is over. The arrow has found its mark. Krishna has passed.

But ideas do not die with their speakers. They travel. They mutate. They find new hosts.

What would a civilization built on the principles Indra offers look like?

Not hedonism, the pursuit of pleasure without discipline. Indra does not teach that.

Not nihilism, the abandonment of meaning. Indra insists that meaning is real, that choices matter, that stakes are not illusion.

It would be a civilization that values sincerity over performance, where saying what you want is respected, and sophisticated evasion is seen for what it is: cowardice wearing philosophy's clothes.

It would honor ambition without apology. The entrepreneur, the artist, the builder, they would not be told to seek liberation instead. They would be told: build, and when you are done, build more.

It would celebrate fierce love. Not as a lower path to be transcended, but as the proof that you are fully engaged with existence. The mother who loves her child ferociously is not spiritually inferior to the monk who loves nothing.

It would embrace righteous anger. The capacity to be outraged by injustice would be cultivated, not stilled.

It would produce art without embarrassment. Beauty would be recognized as a legitimate end, not a distraction from higher pursuits.

It would face death as completion, not escape. A life well-lived would be measured by what it accomplished, not what it transcended.

It would welcome joy without guilt. Celebration would be sacred, and the philosopher who cannot dance would be missing something.

This is not the only way to be human. It is one way.

Indra does not claim his path is for everyone. Some need the peace Krishna offers. Some will find their truest selves in stillness, in surrender, in the dissolution of desire.

That path exists. It has produced saints. It has offered comfort to billions.

This book is for the ones it did not comfort. The ones who read the Gita and felt caged. The ones who were told to stop wanting and could not.

For them, Indra offers an alternative. Not a replacement. An alternative.

The Indragita is finished. But ideas are arrows that never stop flying.

If something in these pages made you uncomfortable, good. Examine the discomfort. It may be the sound of a cage you did not know you were in.

If something in these pages made you feel recognized, better. You are not alone. You never were.

The fire is old. It has been burning since before the Vedas were composed. It will burn after this book is forgotten.

Your only question is whether you will warm yourself by it, or spend your life explaining why fire is dangerous.

Read the Gita. Read this. Choose.

Or better yet: read both, and build something new from the collision.
