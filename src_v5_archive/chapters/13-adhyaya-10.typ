#adhyaya(10, [The Question])

#action[A long silence. The sun had moved across the sky without either of them noticing. The sea had changed from copper to grey to something almost purple. The smoke from Dvaraka was no longer visible, either the wind had shifted, or there was nothing left to burn.]

#action[They had been talking for hours. Or perhaps it had only been minutes. Time moves strangely at the end of yugas.]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[finally] You have spoken well, Sahasraksha.#footnote[Sahasraksha: "Thousand-eyed one," an epithet of Indra.] Better than I expected from one who sends storms against cowherds.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[almost gently] You embarrassed me that day. In front of the three worlds. A child lifting a mountain against the king of heaven.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[a ghost of a smile] I remember. You sent everything you had.

#speaker[Indra] Seven days of storm. The best I could do. And you stood there, one finger, that smile on your face. Do you know how many ages I have been trying to forget that smile?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[the smile returning, faintly] You never will.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[shaking his head] No. I never will.

#action[For a moment, they were not philosopher and challenger. They were two old beings who had known each other for eons, who had fought and tested and survived each other.]

#speaker[Indra] And yet you're here teaching me. Not destroying me.

#speaker[Krishna] If I had come to destroy you, I would have come differently.

#speaker[Indra] I did not come to destroy you either. I came because I see what is coming, and I do not want it for your people.

Your Bharata will meet other civilizations, peoples who did not grow up on your teaching. And those people will want things. They will want land, trade, conquest, dominance. They will not be calmed by talk of maya. They will not be defeated by equanimity.

And your philosophers will be helpless. They will say "why do these mlecchas strive so hard? Do they not know it is all illusion?" And while they are saying this, the mlecchas will be winning.

I do not want this for your people.

#speaker[Krishna] Why do you care?

#speaker[Indra] Because I am Indra. Because I love those who call on me.

#action[His voice softened. He was looking at something very far away, or very long ago.]

I still remember the yajna of your ancestors, Govinda. Before the philosophers came. Before the hierarchies calcified.

They sang to me without irony. They poured the soma without asking if it was spiritually appropriate. They asked for victory, not in some metaphorical sense, but actual victory, over actual enemies. They asked for cattle and sons and rain.

And they #emph[meant] it. There was no gap between word and desire. No sophistication. Just a people asking their god for help, and a god answering.

#action[He looked at Krishna.]

I want that back. Not for my glory. I am old enough to be beyond that. But because I have seen what happens when a people stops asking. When they learn to want nothing. When they philosophize their desires away.

#indent-para[
They become wise. And then they become weak. And then they become enslaved. And then they become forgotten.

I will not watch this happen while the soma is still wet on my lips.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[standing, facing the sea] You want me to renounce my teaching?

#speaker[Indra] I want you to #emph[complicate] it. To say: detachment is one path, for some temperaments, at some stages of life. But it is not THE path. It is not higher. It is not the goal.

The householder who loves his wife fiercely is not lower than the sannyasin who has transcended love.

The king who wants his kingdom to prosper is not less evolved than the sage who sees all outcomes as equal.

The warrior who hates his enemy and wants to destroy him is not spiritually inferior to the one who kills without hatred.

These are different ways of being human. And you have ranked them. You have put the detached above the attached, the cool above the passionate, the transcendent above the engaged.

I am asking you to remove the ranking.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[turning to face him] And if I tell you that you are blind to what I gave?

The fire you love, it burns, Shakra. It consumed Vritra, yes. It also consumed half your devotees. Do you remember them? The warriors who followed your path and died screaming, wanting, unfulfilled? The kings who built empires and watched them crumble? The lovers who loved with your intensity and were destroyed by it?

I gave them a way to live WITH the fire without being destroyed by it. You call it castration. I call it survival. You call it gray. I call it kindness.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[quietly] You gave them survival. I do not dispute that. But survival is not the same as life.

#speaker[Krishna] Without survival, there is no life.

#speaker[Indra] Without fire, survival is merely waiting to die.

#action[The sound of the sea. A bird calls.]

#action[Somewhere in the forest behind them, a twig snapped. A small sound, but both of them heard it.]

#speaker[Krishna] The hunter is coming.

#speaker[Indra] I know.

#action[Another small sound. Closer. The hunter did not know what he was approaching. He thought he was tracking deer.]

#speaker[Krishna] I could avoid him. Even now.

#speaker[Indra] But you won't.

#speaker[Krishna] No. I have seen this death. It is mine.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[standing] Then let me ask you one last thing.

Are you going toward that arrow because it is your karma, your destined exit, the fruit you must not resist?

Or are you going toward it because you #emph[choose] death now, here, at the end of your era, as a statement, as the closing act of a life you authored?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[long pause] I go to the arrow because the play must end. I am the playwright, Shakra. I must exit the stage so the audience can go home.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[very quietly] And if some refuse to leave the theater? If they stay in their seats, wanting more, unable to accept that the story is over?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[looking at him] Those are yours, aren't they?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[nodding slowly] They always were.

#section-heading[The Final Deal]

#speaker[Indra] Then let us make a bargain, you and I.

Keep your Gita, Govinda. Feed it to the masses. Let them find comfort in their chains. Let them survive, since that is what they need. I do not begrudge them.

But give me the mutants.

When a soul is born that cannot be contained by your Dharma...

When a fire burns that your water cannot quench...

When a boy looks at the stars and feels the hunger...

When a girl reads your scripture and feels only the cage...

#indent-para[
That one is mine.
]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[a long silence] You want the restless ones.

#speaker[Indra] I want the ones who cannot rest. The ones for whom your peace feels like suffocation. The ones who read your teaching and think: "This is not for me. There must be another way."

#action[Krishna looked at him for a long moment. Something passed between them, recognition, perhaps. Acknowledgment.]

#speaker[Krishna] I was one of them once.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[quietly] I know. Before you became a teacher, you were a troublemaker. You stole butter. You teased girls. You danced on serpents' heads.

You were mine, Govinda. Before you became everyone's.

#action[Krishna said nothing. But he did not deny it.]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly] There are not many such.

#speaker[Indra] No. There never are. But they are the ones who change the world. They are the ones who build the empires, write the poems, break the chains.

Your teaching is for the ninety-nine. Mine is for the one.

Let them both exist. Let readers choose.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[placing his hand on Indra's arm] May your fire burn until the stars go dark, Sahasraksha.

#speaker[Indra] And may your peace hold those who need it.

#action[For a moment, their hands touched, the god of thunder and the god who had humbled him. Two kings at the end of their roads.]

#speaker[Indra] We are not enemies, Govinda. We are brothers who serve different children.

#action[Indra walked back toward the forest. His footsteps made sound on the earth. His shadow fell in the ordinary way. At the edge of the trees, he turned.]

#speaker[Indra] The teaching I've given you, it has no name yet. Give it one.

#speaker[Krishna] Indragita.

#speaker[Indra] Good. Let this dialogue be my ashwamedha.#footnote[The ashwamedha horse runs wherever it will, and where it runs becomes the king's domain.] These words will run through minds I will never meet, and where they land, I will have kingdom.

Let them read it alongside yours. Let them choose.

#action[He disappears into the trees. Moments later, the thunder rolls, far away, as if laughing.]

#action[Krishna waits for the arrow.]
