#adhyaya(2, [The Worlds Beyond])

#speaker[Krishna] You speak as if your way is proven. But where are your devotees, Shakra? The yajnas grow thin. The soma goes unoffered. Men turn to other gods. Gentler gods. Perhaps they know something you don't.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[laughs] You think I measure truth by headcount? By who burns more ghee in my name? That is the logic of a merchant, not a king.

Let me tell you what I have seen while you played your flute in Vrindavan.

#indent-para[
I have walked in other worlds. Not the heavens. The earth, in places your Bharata does not touch. And I have seen what happens when men organize their lives around different truths.
]

#speaker[Krishna] Other worlds? You mean the mlecchas? What can the barbarians teach?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[sharp] This is the first disease your teaching breeds: the comfort of dismissal. "They are mlecchas, so I need not learn." Tell me, Dvarakadhisha: when men come with their phalanxes and their logic, will you dismiss them then?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quieter] Speak, then. What have you seen?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[pausing] You ask what I have seen. But you know as well as I do, Govinda, that time does not bind us as it binds mortals.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[a faint smile] You wish to show me the future.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[looking out at the sea] Time is a landscape to the devas. You know this. You have seen it yourself. But you have chosen to wear this body, to live inside a single moment. I have not.

I can see the mountains that are yet to rise. The empires that will bloom and wither. The defeats your children have not yet suffered.

#speaker[Krishna] And what do you see?

#speaker[Indra] I see the peoples who will remember what your Bharata forgot. I see what they will build. And I see how they will defeat your children. Not because they are stronger, but because they will still #emph[want] things your philosophers taught your people to stop wanting.

#action[A long silence. The waves spoke their ancient language. Somewhere behind them, smoke still rose from Dvaraka.]

#speaker[Krishna] Show me, then. If you see so clearly, show me what you have seen.

#section-heading[On the Vratya Emperor]

#speaker[Indra] Let me tell you first of your own soil. So you cannot say I come with foreign teachings.

There will rise a man named Chandragupta. Born in the mud. Not Kshatriya by birth. What your priests call a Vratya—an outsider, unclaimed by the Vedic order.

#indent-para[
He will burn with a hunger your philosophers cannot explain. He will want the throne not because it is his dharma, but because he #emph[wants] it. And beside him will stand Chanakya, a Brahmin who understood that philosophy without power is poetry.

Together, they will do what your Pandavas never did: they will build an empire that extends from sea to sea. Not because karma required it. Because Chandragupta #emph[chose] it.
]

#speaker[Krishna] The Mauryas are not yet born.

#speaker[Indra] I have seen them, Govinda. I have seen Chandragupta's face when he takes the throne from the Nandas. Do you know what I saw?

#speaker[Krishna] Tell me.

#speaker[Indra] Fire. Not relief. Not duty. Not performed equanimity. #emph[Fire]. The same fire that burned in me when I slew Vritra. The fire your teaching tells men to extinguish.

And his empire will stand for generations. His grandson will become Ashoka, who will carve his remorse into stone across the subcontinent. But even Ashoka—the one who renounced war—built his conversion on an empire his grandfather's hunger created.

Without the fire, there is nothing to renounce.

#section-heading[On the Greeks]

#speaker[Indra] Now let me speak of peoples farther from your soil.

West of the Sindhu, past the mountains, there is a people who live along an inland sea. They are quarrelsome. They fight amongst themselves constantly.

And yet they have produced more clear thinking in three generations than your rishis produced in thirty.

#speaker[Krishna] Bold claim.

#speaker[Indra] There was a man among them called Aristotle. He asked: what is the purpose of a human life? Not how to escape it. Not how to transcend it. What is it #emph[for]?

His answer: Eudaimonia. Flourishing. A life is good when it fulfills its function excellently. A man is good when he lives well: with courage, with justice, with practical wisdom, with proper pride.

Notice what is missing from his teaching, Keshava.

#speaker[Krishna] Detachment.

#speaker[Indra] Detachment. Liberation. Escape. He did not teach men to flee from the game. He taught them to win it. His student conquered the world from Macedon to your own Sindhu river. Twenty-five years old, weeping because there were no more lands to take.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[leaning forward] And those Greeks you praise, they built their thinking on the backs of slaves. Half their population in chains so the other half could philosophize.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[unflinching] Yes, they had slaves. And your Bharata has caste. Every civilization has its sins. The question is whether their philosophy helps them see it or helps them hide from it.

Your teaching is excellent for hiding. "It is karma. They are working out past debts." That teaching is more cruel than the chains, because it teaches the chained man that his chains are justice.

#section-heading[On the One Who Burned Too Bright]

#speaker[Indra] But let me speak of someone you knew personally. Someone whose fire you had to extinguish because it threatened your order.

Karna.

#action[Krishna's eyes flickered. A beat of silence. The sea was very loud.]

#speaker[Indra] He was born with the armor. My gift to him through his father, Surya. Impenetrable. Unearned by austerity, granted by blood.

And what did he do with it? He #emph[became] something. Not because dharma assigned him a role—he had no role. The Pandavas rejected him. The Kauravas used him. He had no place in your order.

So he carved his own place. With his bow. With his word. With a stubbornness that refused to accept the identity your society assigned him.

#speaker[Krishna] Karna was flawed. His loyalty to Duryodhana—

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cutting him off] His loyalty to Duryodhana was the only nobility available to him. You think he didn't know Duryodhana was flawed? He knew. But Duryodhana was the one who saw him when everyone else saw only a sutaputra.

#emph[That] is loyalty, Govinda. Not the cosmic loyalty you preach—"be loyal to dharma, not to persons." The loyalty that says: this man saw me when no one else would. I will stand with him even unto death.

#speaker[Krishna] And he died for it.

#speaker[Indra] And he #emph[lived] for it. Do you know why the youth of Bharata will always love Karna more than Yudhishthira?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] Tell me.

#speaker[Indra] Because Karna is #emph[alive]. He wanted. He burned. He refused the offer you made him—to switch sides, to become a Pandava, to accept the safe path. He chose his fire over your safety.

Yudhishthira is admirable. Karna is #emph[beloved].

And your philosophy cannot explain why.

#action[Krishna said nothing. He was looking at the ground. When he spoke, his voice was very quiet.]

#speaker[Krishna] I knew what he was. I knew what killing him would cost.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[softer] I know you did. That is why I speak of him. Not to wound you. To show you that even you felt the weight of extinguishing that fire.

#action[A long moment. Then Indra continued, his voice harder again.]

#section-heading[On the Persians]

#speaker[Indra] Further west still, older than the Greeks, there rose a people of fire-keepers. They worship one Lord, Ahura Mazda. And against him stands Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit.

#speaker[Krishna] Dualism. We have outgrown such things. The enlightened see that good and evil are two faces of the same—

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cutting him off] Are what? The same Brahman? Illusions to transcend?

This is precisely your error. The Persians understood something you refuse to accept: #emph[there are sides, and you must choose one].

#indent-para[
Not because you are ignorant. Not because you are "attached." Because #emph[choosing is what it means to be real].

Their wise men teach that every soul is a soldier in a cosmic war. That your actions matter—not in some karmic accounting book, but because right now, in this moment, you are either feeding the light or feeding the darkness.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And who decides which is which?

#speaker[Indra] Truth, Vasudeva. Order. Creation. The man who builds a well knows he has done good. The man who poisons it knows he has done evil. The confusion is performed. It is not real.

#section-heading[On the Kings Who Conquered the Sea]

#speaker[Indra] And let me speak of kings your philosophers never name in their discourses on detachment.

The Cholas.

#indent-para[
When Rajendra Chola looks at the Bay of Bengal, he will not see maya. He will see #emph[territory]. He will build a navy that will sail to Sumatra, to the Malay coast, to the edges of the known world. He will call himself Gangaikonda—the one who conquered the Ganga. Not as metaphor. As #emph[fact].
]

#speaker[Krishna] Conquest for its own sake is—

#speaker[Indra] Is what? Attachment? Ego?

Then call it ego. His ego built Gangaikondacholapuram. His ego sent ships across oceans when your philosophers were debating whether the world was illusion. His ego carved the Brihadeshwara Temple in Thanjavur—a temple so vast that the stone itself seems to breathe, that will stand when the philosophical treatises of that age have turned to dust.

#speaker[Krishna] And where are the Cholas now?

#speaker[Indra] Where are your Yadavas, Govinda?

#action[Silence. The smoke from Dvaraka was still visible on the horizon. A bird called, sharp and lonely.]

#speaker[Indra] #stage[quieter] Empires fall. All of them. The question is not whether a people lasts forever. The question is what they build while they last.

The Cholas built things that will be remembered. Your Yadavas killed each other with iron clubs on a beach, drunk on wine.

Tell me which death is better.

#section-heading[On Those Who Remembered]

#speaker[Indra] And here is the strangest thing I have seen.

Far in the future, the descendants of the Greeks will fall into a dark age. Their learning will be lost. Their temples will crumble. For a thousand years, they will forget what their ancestors knew.

And then—they will remember.

They will call it Renaissance. Rebirth. They will look back at their ancients and say: we can be great again. They will dig up old statues and weep at the beauty. They will read old books and think: we have forgotten how to want things this clearly.

#speaker[Krishna] And what will they build?

#speaker[Indra] Everything. Art, science, exploration, law. In three centuries, they will transform their world.

#indent-para[
A sculptor named Michelangelo will carve a man from marble. He will work for years, obsessed, sleeping beside the stone. When asked why, he will say: "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."

That is not detachment, Keshava. That is love so fierce it reshapes matter itself.
]

But here is what I want you to see, Govinda: #emph[they did it by remembering]. They did not invent a new philosophy. They recovered an old one—the philosophy of excellence, of wanting, of building without apology.

Your Bharata also has something to remember. The Rigvedic spirit. The fire that burned before your philosophers poured water on it.

The Renaissance is not a Western story. It is a #emph[human] story—what happens when a people decides to stop being ashamed of wanting to be great.

I am asking you to give your children permission to remember.

#section-heading[On Fame and Glory]

#speaker[Indra] Those men of the Renaissance were obsessed with two words: #emph[fama] and #emph[gloria]. Fame and glory.

They did not apologize for wanting to be remembered. They knew that a life lived greatly leaves traces in the world, and those traces matter.

#speaker[Krishna] Fame fades. Glory is dust.

#speaker[Indra] And equanimity is ash that never burned. Which would you choose?

#indent-para[
The man who risks failure, who tries with his whole heart and falls short—that man has lived. The man who never tried because trying is attachment, because wanting is bondage, because the wise man is above such things—that man has only waited.

Your teaching produces excellent waiters, Keshava. Men who are very good at not wanting, not trying, not risking. And they will be conquered by those who do.
]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[after a long silence] You speak of peoples who burned bright and then burned out. Where are your Greeks now, Shakra? Where are your Tang? Their empires are dust while my Bharata still stands. My teaching may be gray, but gray endures.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[leaning closer] Does it? Or does it merely last?

There is a difference between a civilization that lives for five thousand years and a civilization that #emph[survives] for five thousand years. One is a fire that keeps burning. The other is ash that takes a long time to scatter.

#action[The sea pulled at the shore. The smoke from Dvaraka had faded—or perhaps there was nothing left to burn.]

#speaker[Indra] I have not finished, Govinda. Let me tell you what happens to peoples who choose survival over vitality.
