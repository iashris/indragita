#adhyaya(4, [On Sincerity and the Culture of Hiding])

#speaker[Indra] Let us speak now of what your teaching does to a society over time.

In the beginning, a few great souls understand you truly. They achieve genuine detachment, not by lying about their desires, but by genuinely transcending them. Janaka. Perhaps Vyasa. A handful.

And I will say this: the few who understood you truly are magnificent. Janaka ruled a kingdom while holding perfect equanimity. Vyasa composed the epic while standing outside it. These are diamonds, Govinda. I honor them.

But notice something. Janaka was a king first, sage second. He built, ruled, conquered, and #emph[then] transcended. Vyasa was a creator first, renunciate second. He fathered dynasties, authored the longest poem in human history, and #emph[then] spoke of detachment.

They fit my mold, not your teaching's. They did not start with "wanting is bondage." They started with wanting, achieved, and then moved beyond. Your teaching tells the boy to skip the achieving.

But the teaching spreads. And ordinary men hear: "Desire is bondage. Attachment is ignorance. The wise man acts without wanting the fruit."

Now. What does an ordinary man do with this teaching?

#speaker[Krishna] He practices. He refines. Over lifetimes, he approaches...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cutting him off] No. I will tell you what he does.

He still wants. He wants wealth, status, pleasure, victory, all the things men want. But now he has been told that wanting is low. It is spiritually inferior. The wanting itself becomes a source of shame.

So he learns to hide his wanting. From others. From himself. He speaks the language of detachment while scheming underneath. He says "I am beyond outcomes" while angling for promotion. He says "All is Brahman" while cheating his neighbor.

#action[A gust of wind came from the sea, carrying the smell of salt and smoke. Neither of them moved.]

I have watched your businessmen, Govinda. They bargain like merchants, scheme like generals, count their coins late into the night, and then speak of "non-attachment" at the evening discourse. The gap between word and deed has become so normal that no one notices it. This is simply how things are.

#speaker[Krishna] This is misuse. Not the teaching itself.

#speaker[Indra] When every student misuses a teaching in the same way, the teaching is at fault.

A teaching that only works for the exceptional is not a teaching for civilization. It is a secret for the few. Janaka could hold a kingdom and equanimity because Janaka was Janaka. But you gave his words to clerks and told them they could be kings of the spirit while remaining clerks of the flesh. They cannot. And pretending otherwise produces hypocrisy, not liberation.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[with sudden force] Every teaching is misused, Shakra. Your Greeks taught virtue and produced tyrants. Your Romans taught duty and built slave markets. Should Aristotle apologize for Alexander's massacres? Should we blame a lamp for the shadows men cast?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[meeting his gaze] Aristotle taught men to pursue excellence, and some pursued it through conquest. That is a corruption of direction, not of spirit. But you taught men to distrust desire itself, and they learned to hide their desires, not refine them. That is not corruption. That is the teaching working exactly as designed.

#section-heading[On Fearless Speech]

#speaker[Indra] Your own tradition once had fearless speech.

In the Sabha Parva, when Draupadi was dragged before the court, she asked a question. Not a philosophical question. A legal one: "Was I staked after Yudhishthira had already lost himself? If so, the bet was invalid."

#action[Krishna's jaw tightened almost imperceptibly.]

Every man in that court knew she was right. Bhishma knew. Drona knew. Vidura knew.

And what did they do? They performed helplessness. They said "It is complex." They said "The Dharma is subtle." They found a thousand ways to avoid saying plainly: "This is wrong, and we are witnessing evil."

#speaker[Krishna] They were constrained by...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[hard] They were constrained by nothing except their own fear of clarity. Draupadi had the fearless speech. The entire court of elders did not.

And your teaching, Govinda, gives men permission to perform that helplessness. "Who can say what is truly right? All perspectives contain truth. The wise man does not take sides."

Draupadi took sides. She demanded justice. She was the most spiritually alive person in that court.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] I was not there that day.

#speaker[Indra] No. You were not. And if you had been?

#action[A long silence. The waves answered their own questions.]

#speaker[Indra] The Greeks have a word for what Draupadi did: #emph[parrhesia]. Fearless speech. The obligation to speak truth plainly, even to power.

But I did not need to go to Greece to find it. Draupadi had it. Your people had it once.

In the lands your teaching shapes now, what happens? A man says "I have no opinion, I am merely a servant of dharma." Or "Who am I to say? All perspectives contain truth." Or "I will meditate on this," meaning: I will avoid the conflict.

You have created a culture afraid of assertion. Afraid of clarity. Afraid of saying: I think this, I want this, I will fight for this.

And you call it spiritual advancement.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] There is violence in assertion. War follows from want.

#speaker[Indra] War follows from life, Vasudeva. The question is not whether to fight. It is whether to fight cleanly, with your reasons spoken aloud, or to fight through manipulation while pretending you are above the fight.

Your Kauravas and Pandavas, did your teaching prevent their war? Or did it merely allow them to spiritualize their slaughter?

#section-heading[On the One Who Refused Dissolution]

#speaker[Indra] And there is another poison in your philosophy. The dissolution of the individual.

You teach that the atman is the same in all beings. That the wise man sees no difference between a brahmin and a dog. That all distinctions are maya.

#speaker[Krishna] This is the highest truth.

#speaker[Indra] It is a truth that destroys individual excellence.

And there is no better example of what you destroy than Karna.

#action[Krishna's expression flickered. The name still carried weight.]

You told Arjuna that the wise man sees no difference between a Brahmin and a dog. That all distinctions are maya. That the atman is the same in all beings.

Karna refused this. He was told: "You are a sutaputra. Your atman is the same as everyone else's. Why struggle?"

And he said: "My atman may be the same. But #emph[I] am Karna. And I will not be dissolved."

His individuality was not ego, Govinda. It was the refusal to let your philosophy erase him.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] He could have been a Pandava. I offered him...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cutting him off] You offered him absorption into your order. A place in your structure. He would have been the sixth Pandava. He chose to remain Karna.

#emph[That] is individuality. Not the ego you warn against. The irreducible core that says: I am not just Brahman wearing a costume. I am #emph[this]. And I will not dissolve.

If I am the same as everyone, why should I strive to be #emph[more] than I am? Why should I develop my particular gifts, cultivate my particular vision, leave my particular mark? It's all the same Brahman anyway.

A civilization of people who believe they are all the same Brahman is a civilization where no one feels the obligation to be #emph[exceptional]. Why bother? It's all illusion anyway.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[after a long pause] You mistake the teaching. The wise man sees unity but still acts...

#speaker[Indra] The wise man acts #emph[dutifully]. Without passion. Without the fire that makes a man do more than he must.

#section-heading[On the Folk Who Kept the Fire]

#speaker[Indra] And here is the strangest irony, Govinda.

The people your philosophers call "low," the ones who dance with masks and blood and fire, have preserved more individual excellence than your "pure" Brahmins.

#action[Indra's eyes unfocused. He was seeing something far away, or perhaps very close.]

I have watched your folk festivals. The ones your priests call "tamasic."

A village in the south. Night. Drums so loud they shake the chest. A man wearing the mask of Bhuta, a local god your Sanskritic tradition never named. He is dancing. No, he is #emph[possessed]. The god is #emph[in] him.

The villagers are not watching a performance. They are witnessing a god take flesh. The dancer's eyes roll back. His voice changes. He speaks prophecy. He names the sins of the village. He demands blood, chicken blood, not human, but still blood, and when it is poured, the whole village #emph[exhales].

#action[His gaze returned to the present.]

Your priests call this superstition. I call it the Rigveda remembered.

When I accepted offerings, I did not want the sacrifice to be serene. I wanted the priest to #emph[feel] something. The soma hit the fire and there was #emph[joy]. Not performed equanimity. Joy.

#indent-para[
The potter who takes fierce pride in his pot. The drummer who becomes the rhythm. The dancer who puts on the demon mask and #emph[becomes] the god. They never heard your teaching about "all being Brahman." And so they still care. They still strive. They still create.
]

You built hierarchies of purity. And the people you placed at the bottom, they kept the fire you were supposed to guard.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[long silence] You speak as if I made the hierarchy. The varnas existed before...

#speaker[Indra] You sanctified them. You gave them cosmic justification. "From my mouth came the Brahmin, from my arms the Kshatriya..." You made a social arrangement into divine law.

And then, this is what I cannot forgive, you told those at the bottom that their place was earned. That their suffering was just. That their children's children's children would suffer because of deeds no one remembers.

#speaker[Krishna] It was meant to give meaning to suffering. Without the karmic frame, suffering is just random cruelty.

#speaker[Indra] So you gave them a frame where suffering is #emph[deserved] cruelty. Is that better?

#action[The sea pulled at the shore. Somewhere far away, a conch sounded, perhaps one of the last Yadavas, still alive, still calling to gods who would not answer.]

I would rather have a civilization of ambitious individuals who believe their souls are unique and their accomplishments matter, who fight and fail and try again, than a civilization of wise men who know it's all maya and therefore give exactly as much effort as dharma requires and not one ounce more.

The first might produce tyrants. The second produces clerks.

#stage[meeting Krishna's eyes]

I know which I would rather fight.
