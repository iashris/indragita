# INDRAGITA V3: Final Edit Action Plan

**Authority**: v3-boss.md (all conflicts resolved in its favor)
**Status**: Pre-launch edit checklist
**Date**: January 2026

---

## PHASE 1: KILL-ON-SIGHT FIXES (Before anything else)

### 1.1 Hyphenation Bug Extermination
**Priority**: ALPHA - Do this first

- [ ] Re-export PDF with hyphenation OFF
- [ ] Global search for `￾` character (the broken soft-hyphen artifact)
- [ ] Verify these specific words are clean:
  - "consciousness" (not "con￾sciousness")
  - "transcendence" (not "tran￾scendence")
  - "attachment" (not "attach￾ment")
  - "observable" (not "ob￾servable")
  - "discontent" (not "discon￾tent")
  - "prisoner" (not "pris￾oner")
- [ ] Test copy-paste from PDF to ensure no artifacts

**Why**: "Indra does not tolerate sloppiness. Your formatting must be as precise as your logic."

---

## PHASE 2: STEEL-MANNING KRISHNA (Content Edits)

The goal: Make Indra's victory sweeter by making Krishna a worthy opponent.

### 2.1 Adhyaya 2 (The Worlds Beyond)
- [ ] Add Krishna's counter-attack:
  > "Your Greeks burned the library at Persepolis. Your Romans salted Carthage. Is destruction the price of vitality?"
- [ ] Let Indra parry with the "Fire without Engine" argument
- [ ] This creates structural symmetry for later chapters

### 2.2 Adhyaya 3 (Karma)
- [ ] Let Krishna define Karma as "Causal Continuity" (Physics), not just "Moral Dessert" (Judgment)
- [ ] Indra then attacks the determinism of physics with Quantum/Will argument

### 2.3 Adhyaya 5 (Love/Loss)
- [ ] Give Krishna one genuine defensive point about love's risks without the Gita's framework
- [ ] Currently Krishna is too passive - let him land a real hit
- [ ] Make the eventual critique feel like "victory over a worthy opponent, not a rout"

---

## PHASE 3: GROUNDING IN BHARATA (Reclaiming Heritage)

Prevent "West-worship" accusations. Show that the "Beautiful Death" and "King-Sage" archetypes are Indian too.

### 3.1 Adhyaya 4 (Sincerity)
- [ ] Acknowledge Janaka or Vyasa as the "Diamonds" produced by the system
- [ ] The Twist: Indra respects them because they were **Kings/Creators first, sages second**
- [ ] They fit Indra's mold, not the "Clerk" mold
- [ ] Add line: "The few who understood you truly are magnificent. Janaka. Perhaps Vyasa. But a teaching that only works for the exceptional is not a teaching for civilization—it is a secret."

### 3.2 Adhyaya 7 (Death)
- [ ] Add Bhishma's Iccha-mrityu (Death by Will) alongside Greek examples
- [ ] Frame it as: "The Beautiful Death is ALSO an Indian concept that we forgot"
- [ ] This reclaims heritage rather than outsourcing glory to Socrates

---

## PHASE 4: MINOR TIGHTENING

### 4.1 Adhyaya 1 (The Descent)
- [ ] Trim Govardhana flashback by 2-3 exchanges
- [ ] Get to philosophy faster - reader knows the myth
- [ ] Keep the power dynamic establishment, just tighter

### 4.2 Adhyaya 6 (Excellence)
- [ ] Consider one concrete modern example
- [ ] Make the "builder who cannot sleep until the temple is perfect" reader feel directly addressed

### 4.3 Footnote Cleanup
- [ ] Check Daiva footnote (Chapter 7) and Kola footnote (Chapter 8)
- [ ] Unify or differentiate more clearly - currently may duplicate information

### 4.4 Transliteration Consistency
- [ ] Pick one style and stick to it: either "rta" or "ṛta"
- [ ] Consistency > correctness for general readers

---

## PHASE 5: THE DISCARD PILE (DO NOT DO)

**v3-boss.md explicitly rejects these suggestions. Ignore them.**

### REJECTED: "Not anti-Krishna" disclaimer
- Reason: Weak. Defensive. The text speaks for itself.
- The ending ("We are brothers") is enough.

### REJECTED: "Soma is just a symbol" clarification
- Reason: Dilution. Let the reader wonder if you mean actual Soma.
- Mystery creates power.

### REJECTED: "Toxic productivity" warning
- Reason: Modern HR speak. Indra does not care about your burnout; he cares about your glory.

### REJECTED: Making power "accountable/legible"
- Reason: Moralizing. The text already says a King who owns his power is better than a sneak. That is enough.

---

## PHASE 6: LAUNCH PREPARATION

### 6.1 Hindi Sampler (Immediate)
- [ ] Translate Adhyaya 6 (Excellence) into Hindi
- [ ] Translate Adhyaya 10 (The Bargain) into Hindi
- [ ] Release as images/PDFs alongside main book
- [ ] "The Hindi Belt needs this fire more than the English elites"

### 6.2 Physical Edition Prep
- [ ] Dark theme design is complete (Night Edition)
- [ ] Consider limited physical first edition for collectors

### 6.3 Defense Preparation
For the Radha critique backlash, have response ready:
> "I am not attacking Krishna. I am attacking the use of philosophy to sanctify abandonment."

For accusations of attacking Hindu philosophy:
> "This book is not for everyone. It says so explicitly. If the Gita serves you, it serves you. This is for the ones it doesn't."

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before declaring V3 complete:

- [ ] PDF hyphenation clean (no ￾ characters)
- [ ] Krishna has genuine counter-arguments in Adhyaya 2, 3, 5
- [ ] Janaka/Vyasa acknowledged in Adhyaya 4
- [ ] Bhishma's Iccha-mrityu present in Adhyaya 7
- [ ] Adhyaya 1 opening trimmed
- [ ] No defensive disclaimers added
- [ ] No Soma clarification added
- [ ] No power accountability moralizing added
- [ ] Hindi sampler ready (Adhyaya 6 + 10)
- [ ] Both Light and Dark editions compile cleanly

## SUMMARY: The Three Commandments

1. **Fix the technical** (hyphenation)
2. **Strengthen the opponent** (Krishna's counters)
3. **Ground in Bharata** (Janaka, Bhishma, Vyasa)

Everything else is either minor polish or explicitly rejected.

*"Let this dialogue be my ashwamedha—these words will run through minds I will never meet, and where they land, I will have kingdom."*

Launch it.
