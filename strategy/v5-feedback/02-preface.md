# V5 Feedback: Preface

## Overall Assessment
The Preface is strong and sets up the intellectual stakes well. It positions the author as an analyst rather than a devotee, which is the right move. However, it could benefit from a few adjustments.

## Specific Recommendations

### 1. Soften the "Outsider Looking Down" Tone
The line "My background spans Eastern and Western philosophy" risks triggering the "West-worship" defense from the start.

**Current:**
> My background spans Eastern and Western philosophy, but my method is closer to data science than theology

**Suggested Revision:**
> My method is closer to data science than theology: pattern recognition, comparative analysis, testing ideas against observable outcomes. I approach these texts as an analyst, asking the hard questions our own rishis asked before the tradition calcified.

*Why:* This frames the analytical approach as *continuous* with Indian intellectual tradition (the rishis questioned everything) rather than imported from outside.

### 2. Add the "We Had This, We Forgot" Frame
Insert a line that positions the Indra perspective as *reclamation*, not importation:

**Add after "The Indo-European philosophical tradition...":**
> The fire that once burned in the Rigveda—where Indra was king, where men asked for victory and cattle without apology—that fire was ours before we forgot it. This book is an attempt at remembering.

### 3. Rhythm: The Preface is Slightly Too Declarative
Every sentence is a statement. Consider adding one moment of vulnerability or uncertainty to make the author human:

**Consider adding:**
> I may be wrong. The tradition I criticize has survived millennia; my critique may not survive a decade. But the questions deserve asking.

## No Major Structural Changes Needed
The Preface does its job. These are polish-level changes.
