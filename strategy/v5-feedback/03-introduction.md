# V5 Feedback: Introduction

## Overall Assessment
The Introduction sets up the mythological frame beautifully. The setting (Prabhasa, Krishna waiting for death) is evocative. The justification for choosing Indra is clever. However, this is where the "Timeline" fix **must** be planted.

## Critical Additions

### 1. ADD: The "Divine Sight" Setup (MANDATORY)
The reader needs to understand—before Adhyaya 2 mentions Greeks—that Indra can see across time. Plant the seed here.

**In the "Why Indra?" section, add this paragraph:**

> Indra, unlike mortal philosophers, is not bound by time's arrow. The Devas see what was, what is, and what will be as a single landscape. What Indra speaks of in this dialogue—peoples not yet born, empires not yet risen—he sees not as prophecy but as observation. To him, the Tang and the Cholas are as present as the Yadavas dying on this beach. This is his authority: not argument, but witness.

*Why:* This pre-emptively kills the "why is he talking about future events?" objection.

### 2. Adjust the "Philosophical Stakes" Section
The current contrast (Gita teaches X, Indragita counters Y) is too neat. It reads like a debate prospectus.

**Soften the framing:**
Instead of "The Indragita counters:", use:
> The Indragita does not refute. It offers an alternative path for those who find the first too cold:

This frames it as a *supplement*, not a takedown. Less defensive readers will follow.

### 3. ADD: Indian Examples in the Introduction
Right now, the Introduction mentions only Bhagavata Purana (Govardhana incident). Add one or two lines hinting at Indian examples of the Indra spirit:

**Add to "Why Indra?" section:**
> And Indra's spirit did not die with his temples. It lived in Chandragupta, the Vratya who built an empire from nothing. It lived in Rajendra Chola, whose ships conquered the sea. It lived in Karna, who refused to be defined by his birth. These are Indra's children, whether they called on him or not.

*Why:* This immediately signals to the Indian reader: "This is not about importing Western values. This is about reclaiming something that was always ours."

## Dialogue Rhythm Note
The Introduction is expository, not dialogue. No rhythm fixes needed here. Save the "interruptions and silences" work for the Adhyayas.
