# V6 References: Vedic Fire for the Indragita

This document compiles the most powerful verses from the Rigveda, Atharvaveda, and Yajurveda that embody the "Indra spirit" and can enrich the Indragita. These are not random selections—each verse was chosen because it supports the philosophical argument or provides authentic Vedic grounding for Indra's voice.

## THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS: Verses That Demolish Krishna's Position

### 1. Nasadiya Sukta (RV 10.129) — Desire as Primordial Force

This is the most powerful weapon. The Rigveda itself says DESIRE (kāma) is the origin of creation.

> **[10.129.04]** "Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit. Sages who searched with their heart's thought discovered the existent's kinship in the non-existent."

**How to use**: Indra should quote this directly in Adhyaya 3:
> "Your oldest text, Govinda—the Rigveda that your priests claim to revere—says this: 'Thereafter rose Desire in the beginning, Desire, the primal seed and germ of Spirit.' Kāma. Wanting. Your ancestors knew that desire is not bondage—it is the origin of everything. When did you start teaching otherwise?"

### 2. The Questioning Spirit (RV 10.129.6-7)

The Vedas themselves question. They do not claim certainty.

> **[10.129.06]** "Who verily knows and who can here declare it, whence it was born and whence comes this creation? The Gods are later than this world's production. Who knows then whence it first came into being?"

> **[10.129.07]** "He, the first origin of this creation, whether he formed it all or did not form it, Whose eye controls this world in highest heaven, he verily knows it, or perhaps he knows not."

**How to use**: Against later orthodoxy and certainty:
> "Your Vedas asked questions, Govinda. 'Who verily knows? Perhaps he knows not.' That was the spirit—inquiry, not dogma. When did your children stop questioning and start reciting?"

### 3. Hiranyagarbha Sukta (RV 10.121) — The Refrain of Wonder

Each verse ends with: "What God shall we adore with our oblation?" This is not certainty—it is searching.

> **[10.121.01]** "In the beginning rose Hiranyagarbha, born Only Lord of all created beings. He fixed and holdeth up this earth and heaven. What God shall we adore with our oblation?"

> **[10.121.02]** "Giver of vital breath, of power and vigour, he whose commandments all the Gods acknowledge. The Lord of death, whose shade is life immortal. What God shall we adore with our oblation?"

**How to use**: The Vedic spirit was seeking, not settling.

## INDRA'S OWN VOICE: Hymns That Define His Character

### 4. The Vritra Hymn (RV 1.32) — Indra the Dragon-Slayer

This is Indra's defining act. He did not achieve equanimity about the waters being trapped. He was ANGRY. And he acted.

> **[1.32.01]** "I WILL declare the manly deeds of Indra, the first that he achieved, the Thunder-wielder. He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters, and cleft the channels of the mountain torrents."

> **[1.32.03]** "Impetuous as a bull, he chose the Soma and in three sacred beakers drank the juices. Maghavan grasped the thunder for his weapon, and smote to death this firstborn of the dragons."

> **[1.32.05]** "Indra with his own great and deadly thunder smote into pieces Vṛtra, worst of Vṛtras. As trunks of trees, what time the axe hath felled them, low on the earth so lies the prostrate Dragon."

> **[1.32.15]** "Indra is King of all that moves and moves not, of creatures tame and horned, the Thunder-wielder. Over all living men he rules as Sovran, containing all as spokes within the felly."

**How to use**: Indra should invoke this when defending action over contemplation:
> "When I slew Vritra, I did not achieve equanimity about the waters being trapped. I was angry that they were imprisoned. My anger liberated them. 'He slew the Dragon, then disclosed the waters.' That is what your Rigveda says of me. Not 'he transcended his attachment to the waters' flow.'"

### 5. Indra's Birth Hymn (RV 4.18) — The Primordial Rebel

Indra was born breaking rules. He "issued forth obliquely" from his mother's side.

> **[4.18.02]** "Not this way go I forth: hard is the passage. Forth from the side obliquely will I issue. Much that is yet undone must I accomplish; one must I combat and the other question."

> **[4.18.04]** "What strange act shall he do, he whom his Mother bore for a thousand months and many autumns? No peer hath he among those born already, nor among those who shall be born hereafter."

> **[4.18.05]** "Deeming him a reproach, his mother hid him, Indra, endowed with all heroic valour. Then up he sprang himself, assumed his vesture, and filled, as soon as born, the earth and heaven."

> **[4.18.10]** "The Heifer hath brought forth the Strong, the Mighty, the unconquerable Bull, the furious Indra. The Mother left her unlicked Calf to wander, seeking himself, the path that he would follow."

**How to use**: Indra's nature is to break convention:
> "I was born breaking the rules, Govinda. 'Not this way go I forth,' I said. 'Forth from the side obliquely will I issue.' Even my birth was a refusal to follow the expected path. Do you think I would teach your children to follow paths others have laid?"

## GLORY, WEALTH, AND VICTORY: What the Vedas Actually Ask For

The Rigveda is full of prayers for very material things: wealth, victory, fame, sons, cattle. This is NOT the Gita's "be indifferent to outcomes."

### 6. Prayers for Conquering Wealth

> **[1.8.01]** "INDRA, bring wealth that gives delight, the victor's ever-conquering wealth, Most excellent, to be our aid."

> **[1.8.03]** "Aided by thee, the thunder-armed, Indra, may we lift up the bolt, And conquer all our foes in fight."

> **[1.9.07]** "Give, Indra, wide and lofty fame, wealthy in cattle and in strength, Lasting our life-time, failing not."

> **[1.9.08]** "Grant us high fame, O Indra, grant riches bestowing thousands, those Fair fruits of earth borne home in wains."

**How to use**: The Vedic ancestors wanted things. They asked for victory, wealth, fame. They were not ashamed of wanting.
> "Your ancestors prayed: 'Give, Indra, wide and lofty fame.' They asked for wealth. They asked for victory. They asked for sons. They were not ashamed of wanting. When did wanting become sin?"

### 7. The Never-Conquered Conqueror

> **[1.11.02]** "Strong in thy friendship, Indra, Lord of power and might, we have no fear. We glorify with praises thee, the never-conquered conqueror."

> **[1.4.04]** "Go to the wise unconquered One, ask thou of Indra, skilled in song, Him who is better than thy friends."

## FIRE AND VITALITY: Agni Hymns

The Rigveda opens with Agni—fire. This is not accidental. Fire is the central symbol.

### 8. Agni as Giver of All Things

> **[1.1.01]** "I Laud Agni, the chosen Priest, God, minister of sacrifice, The hotar, lavishest of wealth."

> **[1.1.03]** "Through Agni man obtaineth wealth, yea, plenty waxing day by day, Most rich in heroes, glorious."

> **[1.31.07]** "For glory, Agni, day by day, thou liftest up the mortal man to highest immortality, Even thou who yearning for both races givest them great bliss."

### 9. Fire as Destroyer of Enemies

> **[1.12.05]** "O Agni, radiant One, to whom the holy oil is poured, burn up Our enemies whom fiends protect."

**How to use**: Fire is not passive. Fire transforms. Fire destroys.

---

## THE GODDESS SPEAKS: Devi Sukta (RV 10.125)

This is Vak (Speech/Goddess) speaking in the first person. It shows that the Vedic tradition has fierce, powerful feminine energy—not just passive shakti.

> **[10.125.03]** "I am the Queen, the gatherer-up of treasures, most thoughtful, first of those who merit worship. Thus Gods have stablished me in many places with many homes to enter and abide in."

> **[10.125.05]** "I, verily, myself announce and utter the word that Gods and men alike shall welcome. I make the man I love exceeding mighty, make him a sage, a Ṛṣi, and a Brahman."

> **[10.125.06]** "I bend the bow for Rudra that his arrow may strike and slay the hater of devotion. I rouse and order battle for the people, and I have penetrated Earth and Heaven."

> **[10.125.08]** "I breathe a strong breath like the wind and tempest, the while I hold together all existence. Beyond this wide earth and beyond the heavens I have become so mighty in my grandeur."

**How to use**: Even the feminine divine in the Vedas is powerful, active, ordering battle:
> "Your goddess speaks in the Rigveda: 'I bend the bow for Rudra that his arrow may strike. I rouse and order battle for the people.' She is not passive shakti waiting to be activated. She is fire."

## YAJURVEDA: The Spirit of Action

The Yajurveda is about ritual action. It emphasizes vigor, energy, impelling force.

### 10. Vigor and Impulsion

> **[YV 1.1]** "THEE for food. Thee for vigour. Ye are breezes. To noblest work God Savitar impel you."

> **[YV 1.5]** "I will observe the vow, Lord of Vows, Agni! May I have strength therefor. Success attend me. Now into truth from untruth do I enter."

> **[YV 2.23]** "We have combined with lustre, vigour, bodies; we have united with the blessèd spirit. May Tvashtar, bounteous giver, grant us riches, and clear each fault and blemish from the body."

> **[YV 3.13]** "You two will I invoke, O Indra-Agni, will please you both together with oblation. Givers, you twain, of vigorous strength and riches, you twain do I invoke for gain of vigour."

**How to use**: The Yajurveda is about DOING. "To noblest work God Savitar impel you." This is not "act without attachment to outcome." This is "be impelled to noble work."

---

## ATHARVAVEDA: Power, Mastery, Dominion

The Atharvaveda has a more practical, even magical quality. It's about gaining power over circumstances.

### 11. Prayers for Supremacy

> **[AV 1.9.01]** "May Indra, Pūshan, Varuria, Mitra, Agni, benignant Gods, maintain this man in riches. May the Ādityas and the Vive Devas set and support him in supremest lustre."

> **[AV 1.9.02]** "May light, O Gods, be under his dominion, Agni, the Sun, all that is bright and golden. Prostrate beneath our feet his foes and rivals. Uplift him to the loftiest cope of heaven."

> **[AV 1.20.04]** "A mighty Ruler thus art thou, unconquered, vanquisher of foes, Even thou whose friend is never slain, whose friend is never overcome."

> **[AV 1.29.01]** "With that victorious Amulet which strengthened Indra's power and might, Do thou, O Brāhmanaspati, increase our strength for kingly sway."

**How to use**: The Vedas pray for dominion, for the defeat of rivals. This is not "treat victory and defeat the same."

## A NOTE ON AUTHENTICITY

These translations are from the Griffith translation, which is public domain and widely accessible. For publication, consider:
1. Cross-referencing with other translations (Doniger, Jamison-Brereton)
2. Including Sanskrit where particularly powerful
3. Consulting with a Vedic scholar for nuance

The core point stands regardless of translation: the Rigveda is a text of desire, action, fire, questioning, and glory-seeking. It is NOT a text of detachment, equanimity, and transcendence. That came later.

Indra's argument is: "Read your own ancestors. They wanted. They fought. They celebrated. When did you forget?"
