Supplemental Editorial Instructions (The "Razor's Edge")
1. Refine the "Partition" Vision (Adhyaya 2)
The Trap: Making it sound like a standard political rant about 1947.

The Fix: Focus on the Aesthetics of the Surrender.

Indra shouldn't just be mad that India was divided. He should be disgusted by the relief with which it was accepted.

Instruction: "Indra must mock the 'Nobel Prize' mindset. He must mock the desire to be patted on the head for being 'peaceful' while the mother's legs were being cut off. He despises the moral vanity of the victim."

2. The "Skin vs. Spirit" Irony (Adhyaya 3)
The Trap: Making the "Fairness/Caste" point feel like a modern "Social Justice" lecture.

The Fix: Frame it as Aesthetic Hypocrisy.

Instruction: "Indra should point out the irony: 'You worship the skin of the Aryans (fairness) but you spit on the spirit of the Aryans (vitality).' This connects the modern obsession with 'Fair & Lovely' to the ancient loss of the Vedic spirit. It cuts deeper than just calling them racists."

3. The "Hunter" as a Ticking Clock (All Chapters)
The Trap: The philosophical debate becomes too abstract and we forget they are sitting in a dying forest.

The Fix: Use the Sensory Details of Death.

Instruction: "As outlined in the arc doc, use the Hunter (Jara) as a metronome.

Chapter 2: A twig snaps. Krishna flinches. (Fear of physical death vs. Philosophical death).

Chapter 3: The sound of the sea gets louder, drowning out a point about dharma. (Nature doesn't care about philosophy).

Chapter 4: A shadow moves in the periphery. (Time is running out)."

4. The "Nuclear Weapon" Quote (Adhyaya 3)
The Instruction: "Ensure the Nasadiya Sukta (RV 10.129.4) quote is placed at the climax of Adhyaya 3. It must be the mic-drop moment. Indra shouldn't just quote it; he should wield it. 'Your own holiest hymn says Desire came first. Before Gods. Before Dharma. Desire. When did you decide you were wiser than the First Seed?'"
