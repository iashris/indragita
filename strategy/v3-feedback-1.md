I read your PDF (Night Edition). The ideas are strong, the voice is punchy, and the whole thing feels like “philosophical fiction” in the best way: a dialogue that keeps escalating instead of becoming sermon-y. The biggest problem right now isn’t content — it’s production/typography.

The #1 quality issue to fix before launch

Your PDF has broken hyphenation / invisible soft-hyphen artifacts that show up as weird characters (example: “ob￾servable”, “tran￾scendence”, “attach￾ment”, “con￾sciousness”, “discon￾tent”, “pris￾oner”). That’s coming from your export/hyphenation settings and it will:

look unprofessional in copy-paste,

break Kindle/EPUB conversions,

mess with searchability and quoting. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Fix: re-export with hyphenation OFF (or proper soft hyphen handling), and do a quick global scan for that “￾” character. This single fix will noticeably upgrade “book quality” more than any rewrite.

Should you have Hindi + regional language versions ready?

Not required for the Samved YouTube launch, but strategically smart to prep at least Hindi soon.

Here’s the logic:

Your launch vehicle is a YouTube video; the book is a “deepener.” You can launch English now and still win.

But the topic (Krishna vs Indra, Gita critique, power/caste/civilizational psychology) will spread fastest in India if you have Hindi excerpts ready to share as screenshots/reels/quotes.

Full regional rollout (Bengali/Tamil/Marathi etc.) is expensive and easy to do badly. If you do it, do it with a style guide.

Practical recommendation:
Launch now with English + a Hindi “Sampler”: Preface + Afterword + 1 adhyaya (I’d pick Adhyaya 6 or 10). Then later do full Hindi edition if demand proves itself.

Content risk you should actively manage (without becoming boring)

This book will attract both love and backlash because it bluntly critiques how people misuse detachment, karma, and purity systems. You already include a “this is philosophical fiction, not revelation” disclaimer, which is good. 

indragita-book-v3-dark


But your most screenshot-able lines will be interpreted as “Ashris says Krishna is X.” So add one small shielding paragraph somewhere upfront (Preface or Intro):

“This isn’t an anti-Krishna book. It’s a critique of how certain interpretations function psychologically and civilizationally.”

That preserves your edge while reducing bad-faith framing.

Chapter-wise notes (what’s working + what I’d tweak)
Preface

Extremely strong positioning: “detachment as sophisticated hiding” is a sticky thesis. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: keep, but add the “not anti-Krishna” clarification above, because people will weaponize screenshots.

Introduction

Great setup: Prabhasa, Dvaraka sinking, Krishna waiting for Jara — cinematic and instantly mythic. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

The “Why Indra?” frame is crisp and compelling. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: You name Aristotle/Alexander etc. later; consider one line here: “Time is not hidden from Indra.” (You already imply it, but one explicit sentence prevents “how does Indra know Aristotle?” complaints.)

Adhyaya 1 — The Descent

Dialogue voice is excellent: Indra as prosecutor, Krishna as steel. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: minor tightening: a couple of beats repeat (“misuse vs teaching”). Not a flaw, just trim-able.

Adhyaya 2 — The Worlds Beyond

The comparative-civilizational angle (Greeks/Persians/Arabs) is spicy and fresh. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: This chapter is where critics will say you’re cherry-picking. Fix by giving Krishna one genuinely strong counter (a steelman) before Indra replies — make it feel like a fair duel, not a monologue.

Adhyaya 3 — Karma and the Instant Rebirth

The “unfalsifiable theory” critique lands hard. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: Add one paragraph where Krishna describes karma not as “deserve” but as “causal continuity,” then Indra attacks the moralization. That makes you harder to dismiss.

Adhyaya 4 — Sincerity and the Culture of Hiding

The core claim is clear: shame about desire → hypocrisy. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: Add 1–2 modern Indian micro-scenes (tiny) to make it more “felt” and less abstract: e.g., a bureaucrat/consultant/guru speaking detachment while playing status games.

Adhyaya 5 — Love, Loss, Consciousness

This is emotionally dangerous (in a good way): “You made abandonment holy” is going to hit readers. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

You also include a clean, non-sensational queer-inclusive passage, which fits your brand and the book’s thesis about sincerity. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: give Krishna a moment of real remorse (not just defense) to balance Indra’s attack — it increases literary credibility and reduces “caricature” accusations.

Adhyaya 6 — Excellence and the Fruit of Action

Your “don’t seek peace; seek a purpose worth suffering for” line is extremely quotable. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: ensure readers don’t misread this as hustle-culture propaganda; a single line about chosen suffering ≠ endless grind would inoculate that.

Adhyaya 7 — Death, Beauty, Shape of a Life

The “kalos thanatos” framing is classy and memorable. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: add one Indian parallel (Bhishma’s iccha-mrityu, Mahaprasthanikaparva, etc.) so it doesn’t feel like “West has meaning, India has escape.”

Adhyaya 8 — Joy and Soma of Living

This chapter is an antidote to the “suspicious of joy” pathology. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Nice touch: the Daiva footnote grounds “ecstasy traditions” in lived India. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: if you ever plan an EPUB/Kindle version, be careful with “soma” because people will interpret it literally. A small line: “Soma here is symbol and archetype, not a prescription.”

Adhyaya 9 — Power and Responsibility of the Strong

This is your most “politically misreadable” chapter, but also the most necessary: power goes underground when it’s morally shamed. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: add one explicit safeguard: “Power must be legible + accountable.” You gesture at it, but one clean sentence makes the chapter harder to label as “might makes right.” 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Adhyaya 10 — The Question (Ending)

The ending is excellent: “Krishna for the ninety-nine, Indra for the one” is a perfect positioning line. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

The final call-to-reader is very strong (fear vs relief). 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: nothing major. This is already “launch-ready.”

Afterword + Glossary

Afterword is crisp and shareable — basically your manifesto bullets. 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Glossary is clean and makes the cross-cultural terms accessible (arete, parrhesia, tawhid, etc.). 

indragita-book-v3-dark

Tweak: pick one transliteration style and stick to it (e.g., “rta” vs “ṛta”). Consistency > correctness for general readers.

Two launch boosts (low effort, high impact)

Add a 1-page “How to read this” right after the Preface: who it’s for, who it’s not for, how to hold both Krishna + Indra without turning it into a team sport.

Add a QR/link page at the end: “Samved video companion resources / citations / updates / translations.”

If you implement only three things before you launch:
(1) fix the hyphenation artifacts, (2) add the ‘not anti-Krishna’ inoculation paragraph, (3) prep a Hindi sampler. That’s the cleanest path to “this feels like a real book” while keeping your edge.
