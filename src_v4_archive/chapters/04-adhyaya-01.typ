#adhyaya(1, [The Descent])

At the edge of Prabhasa, where the forest meets the sea, Krishna sat alone. The Yadavas had slain each other. The city of Dvaraka was sinking. The age was turning.

#indent-para[
He had known it would end this way. He had seen it, spoken it, allowed it.

The hunter's arrow would come soon. He was waiting for it the way one waits for a guest who is late but certain.

Instead, Indra came.
]

Not in thunder. Not with the host of Maruts. He came as a man comes to another man, walking out of the tree line, his footsteps making sound on the earth, his shadow falling in the ordinary way. Only his eyes held the storm.

#speaker[Indra] You taught the world to let go. And now you sit here, letting go. I want to know if it feels the way you promised it would.

#speaker[Krishna] You've come to gloat, Shakra? The one who sent storms against cowherds because a child embarrassed him?

#speaker[Indra] I came to ask a question. I'll only stay if you can bear to answer it honestly.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slight smile] Honesty. You think I've been dishonest?

#speaker[Indra] I think you've been so clever that you've forgotten what honesty costs. You told Arjuna that the wise grieve neither for the living nor the dead. You told him the soul is eternal, the body is clothes, death is a change of garments.

#speaker[Krishna] This is true.

#speaker[Indra] And did Arjuna fight better for believing it? Or did he fight the way a man fights when he's been told it doesn't matter?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[steel in his voice] He fought. He won. The righteous sit on their thrones. Is that not what wars are for?

#speaker[Indra] The war ended. Yes. I was there when Bhishma fell. I watched Arjuna's face. Do you know what I saw?

#speaker[Krishna] Tell me.

#speaker[Indra] Relief. Not victory. Not grief. Not even hatred fulfilled. Relief that it was over. That he could stop performing the thing you'd asked him to perform.

#speaker[Krishna] You misread him. Arjuna carried the Gandiva. He was my instrument and my friend. You, who have never carried anything but your own ambition, cannot read such a man.

#speaker[Indra] I have killed more enemies than you have hairs on your body, Vasudeva. I know what a warrior's face looks like when he wins. That was not it.

#speaker[Krishna] What would you have had me teach him? To slaughter his grandfather with joy? To laugh while cutting down his teachers?

#speaker[Indra] I would have had you teach him to #emph[want] his victory. To own it. To say: I am killing Bhishma because I choose to, because the throne matters to me, because my brothers matter to me, because I refuse to live as a beggar when I was born a prince.

#speaker[Krishna] And the sin of killing?

#speaker[Indra] Let him carry it! Let him feel its weight! A man who kills and feels nothing is not liberated. He is broken. You taught him to pre-forgive himself by pretending he wasn't really the one doing it. That Time was the killer. That the selves were already dead.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quieter] It was a mercy.

#speaker[Indra] It was a trick. And tricks produce tricksters. I have watched your pundits, Keshava. They speak of detachment while scheming for temple gold. They quote your "action without fruit" while angling for the king's ear. The gap between word and deed has become so normal that no one notices it.

#speaker[Krishna] You would judge my teaching by its worst students?

#speaker[Indra] When every student misreads a teaching the same way, the teaching is at fault. Tell me: in the ages since Kurukshetra, what has your philosophy made? Saints? Yes, rare, like diamonds. And hypocrites, common, like dust. The hypocrites cloak themselves in the saints' words, and your civilization slowly, beautifully, sinks into sophisticated helplessness.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[rising, facing him] And your path, Shakra? To feel every death, every failure, every wound without the armor of perspective? How many of your devotees have you driven to madness with that weight? I taught men to carry the unbearable by making it lighter. You would crush them with truth.

#speaker[Indra] I would make them strong enough to be crushed and rise again.

#speaker[Krishna] Strong. You speak of strength. You who lost your worshippers to a cowherd's rebellion. You whose throne shakes whenever a mortal's austerities grow too great. Teach me about strength.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[sitting down across from him] I will. Because I have done what you have never done. I have wanted things, and failed to get them, and remained Indra. I did not console myself by saying I never really wanted them. I did not say desire is the enemy. I lost, and I wanted, and I kept wanting, and I tried again.

That is the teaching.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly sitting back down] Then speak. The arrow is not yet here. I will listen. Not because I agree, but because even the old must sometimes hear new questions.

#speaker[Indra] Not new questions, Govinda. The oldest questions. The ones you buried when you chose safety over fire.
