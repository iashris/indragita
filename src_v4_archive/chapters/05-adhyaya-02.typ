#adhyaya(2, [The Worlds Beyond])

#speaker[Krishna] You speak as if your way is proven. But where are your devotees, Shakra? The yajnas grow thin. The soma goes unoffered. Men turn to other gods. Gentler gods. Perhaps they know something you don't.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[laughs] You think I measure truth by headcount? By who burns more ghee in my name? That is the logic of a merchant, not a king.

Let me tell you what I have seen while you played your flute in Vrindavan.

#indent-para[
I have walked in other worlds. Not the heavens. The earth, in places your Bharata does not touch. And I have seen what happens when men organize their lives around different truths.
]

#speaker[Krishna] Other worlds? You mean the mlecchas? What can the barbarians teach?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[sharp] This is the first disease your teaching breeds: the comfort of dismissal. "They are mlecchas, so I need not learn." Tell me, Dvarakadhisha: when men come with their phalanxes and their logic, will you dismiss them then?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quieter] Speak, then. What have you seen?

#pagebreak()
#section-heading[On the Greeks]

#speaker[Indra] West of the Sindhu, past the mountains where even your Pandavas did not walk, there is a people who live along an inland sea. They are quarrelsome. They fight amongst themselves constantly. Their cities war against their own kin.

And yet, listen to me, they have produced more clear thinking in three generations than your rishis produced in thirty.

#speaker[Krishna] Bold claim.

#speaker[Indra] There was a man among them called Aristotle. He asked: what is the purpose of a human life? Not how to escape it. Not how to transcend it. What is it #emph[for]?

#speaker[Krishna] And his answer?

#speaker[Indra] Eudaimonia. Flourishing. He said: a life is good when it fulfills its function excellently. An eye is good when it sees well. A knife is good when it cuts well. A man is good when he lives well: with courage, with justice, with practical wisdom, with proper pride.

Notice what is missing from his teaching, Keshava.

#speaker[Krishna] Detachment.

#speaker[Indra] Detachment. Liberation. Escape. He did not teach men to flee from the game. He taught them to win it. To play it beautifully. His student conquered the world from Macedon to your own Sindhu river. Twenty-five years old, weeping because there were no more lands to take.

Was that man "attached"? Yes. Was he "bound by desire"? Yes.

Was he #emph[alive]? More alive than ten thousand of your detached karma-yogis put together.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[leaning forward] And those Greeks you praise, they built their thinking on the backs of slaves. Half their population in chains so the other half could philosophize.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[unflinching] Yes, they had slaves. And your Bharata has caste. Every civilization has its sins. The question is not whether a people has darkness. The question is whether their philosophy helps them see it or helps them hide from it.

Your teaching is excellent for hiding. "It is karma. They are working out past debts." The confusion you create is not less cruel than the chains of the Greeks. It is more cruel, because it teaches the chained man that his chains are justice.

#section-heading[On the Persians]

#speaker[Indra] Further west still, and older than the Greeks, there rose a people of fire-keepers. They worship one Lord, Ahura Mazda, they call him. The Wise Lord. And against him stands Angra Mainyu, the destructive spirit.

#speaker[Krishna] Dualism. We have outgrown such things. The enlightened see that good and evil are two faces of the same...

#speaker[Indra] #stage[cutting him off] Are what? Two sides of the same coin? Illusions to transcend?

This is precisely your error. The Persians understood something you refuse to accept: #emph[there are sides, and you must choose one].

#indent-para[
Not because you are ignorant. Not because you are "attached." Because #emph[choosing is what it means to be real].

Their wise men teach that every soul is a soldier in a cosmic war. That your actions matter. Not in some karmic accounting book, but because right now, in this moment, you are either feeding the light or feeding the darkness.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And who decides which is which?

#speaker[Indra] Truth, Vasudeva. Order. Creation. These are not puzzles to be dissolved through cleverness. The man who builds a well knows he has done good. The man who poisons it knows he has done evil. The confusion is performed. It is not real.

Your teaching gives men permission to perform that confusion. To say "who is the slayer, who is the slain" and feel wise while avoiding the weight of what they've done.

#section-heading[On the Tang and the Chola]

#speaker[Indra] But let me speak of peoples closer to your own soil, so you cannot dismiss them as mlecchas.

Far to the east, beyond the mountains, there will rise a dynasty called Tang. Their emperor will open the roads to every corner of the world. Persians, Indians, Arabs, Turks. All walking the same streets of Chang'an, the greatest city the world has ever seen.

And their poets! They will write verses that shake heaven. Li Bai, drunk on wine, pulling the moon from the river. Du Fu, weeping for the fallen soldiers, his grief a blade that cuts through centuries. These men did not seek equanimity. They sought #emph[intensity]. They wanted to feel everything, and they poured that feeling into words that will outlast empires.

#speaker[Krishna] Poets are not philosophers.

#speaker[Indra] No. They are better. They do not explain life. They #emph[live] it, so fiercely that others can taste it through their words.

And look at your own south, Govinda. The Cholas will build an empire of the sea. Their ships will sail to Sumatra, to Cambodia, to the edges of the world. They will carve temples so vast that the stone itself seems to breathe. Brihadeshwara. Gangaikondacholapuram.

Were the Chola kings "detached"? Did Rajendra sit in meditation while his rivals gathered strength? No. He wanted glory. He wanted his name carved in stone. He wanted the Ganga waters brought south as a trophy of conquest. And because he wanted, he built things that will stand when your philosophy is forgotten.

#section-heading[On Unapologetic Ambition]

#speaker[Indra] Let me tell you about a time that will come, many ages hence, in the lands of the Greeks' descendants.

There will be a rebirth. They will call it the Renaissance. Men and women will look back at the ancients and say: we can be great again. Not by transcending desire, but by #emph[embracing] it.

#indent-para[
A sculptor named Michelangelo will carve a man from marble. David. He will work for years, obsessed, sleeping beside the stone, waking to chip away imperfection. When asked why he labored so, he will say: "I saw the angel in the marble and carved until I set him free."

That is not detachment, Keshava. That is love so fierce it reshapes matter itself.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And what of humility? What of the dangers of pride?

#speaker[Indra] There will be a man called Benvenuto Cellini. Goldsmith, sculptor, brawler, braggart. He will write his life story, and in it he will say without shame: I am the greatest artist who ever lived. My work is perfect. I am favored by God.

Your philosophers would call this ego. Attachment. Bondage.

But Cellini's Perseus still stands in Florence. His saltcellar is in Vienna. His work outlived his boasting because the boasting was #emph[true]. He had earned the right to it through excellence.

#speaker[Krishna] Not everyone can be Cellini.

#speaker[Indra] No. But everyone can #emph[try]. And that is the difference.

#indent-para[
There will be a young philosopher in that same age, Pico della Mirandola, who will say something extraordinary. He will say that God gave every other creature a fixed nature: a dog must be a dog, a lion must be a lion. But to man alone, God gave #emph[no fixed nature].

Man can sink to the level of a vegetable. Passive. Consuming. Asleep.

Or man can rise to the level of the divine. Creating. Striving. #emph[Choosing].
]

The choice is what makes us human. And your teaching, Govinda, tells men that the highest choice is to stop choosing. To dissolve the self that chooses. To become as indifferent as stone.

#section-heading[On Fame and Glory]

#speaker[Indra] The men of the Renaissance were obsessed with two words: #emph[fama] and #emph[gloria]. Fame and glory.

They did not apologize for wanting to be remembered. They did not call it attachment. They knew that a life lived greatly leaves traces in the world, and those traces matter.

#speaker[Krishna] Fame fades. Glory is dust.

#speaker[Indra] And equanimity is ash that never burned. Which would you choose?

#indent-para[
The man who risks failure, who tries with his whole heart and falls short. That man has lived. The man who never tried because trying is attachment, because wanting is bondage, because the wise man is above such things. That man has only waited.

Your teaching produces excellent waiters, Keshava. Men who are very good at not wanting, not trying, not risking. And they will be conquered by those who do.
]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[after a long silence] You speak of peoples who burned bright and then burned out. Where are your Greeks now, Shakra? Where are your Tang? Their empires are dust while my Bharata still stands. My teaching may be gray, but gray endures.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[leaning closer] Does it? Or does it merely last? There is a difference between a civilization that lives for five thousand years and a civilization that #emph[survives] for five thousand years. One is a fire that keeps burning. The other is ash that takes a long time to scatter.

I have not finished, Govinda. Let me tell you what happens to peoples who choose survival over vitality.
