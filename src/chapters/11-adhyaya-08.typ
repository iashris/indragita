#adhyaya(8, [On Joy and the Soma of Living])

#speaker[Indra] I have been harsh with you, Govinda. Let me now speak of something gentler.

Joy.

When I drink the soma,#footnote[Soma: A sacred ritual drink in Vedic tradition, offered to the gods and consumed by priests. Its exact botanical identity is debated, but it was central to Rigvedic worship.] I do not drink it dutifully. I do not drink it as a sacrifice, thinking: "This is required of me, but I am not attached to the pleasure." I drink it because it is good. Because the world becomes brighter and the edges become sharper and for a few hours I feel what it is to be fully awake.

Is this attachment? Yes. Is this bondage? I don't care.

#speaker[Krishna] The wise man finds joy in the self alone, not in external---

#speaker[Indra] The wise man finds joy wherever joy is found. In the self, yes. Also in the world. In a well-cooked meal. In the sound of rain. In the body of a lover. In the satisfaction of a problem solved. In the laughter of children.

Your teaching produces people who are suspicious of joy. Who interrogate their own pleasures: "Am I attached? Is this spiritual? Should I feel guilty for feeling good?"

This is a particular kind of cruelty---to make people ashamed of the one thing that makes existence bearable.

#speaker[Krishna] I never taught shame. I taught discrimination---viveka---the ability to distinguish between---

#speaker[Indra] Between higher and lower pleasures. Yes. And lo and behold, the higher pleasures are always the ones that require discipline and denial, and the lower pleasures are always the ones that feel good.

Do you see what this does? It creates a hierarchy where joy is always slightly suspect. Where the man who laughs too easily is less evolved than the man who maintains equanimity.

But laughter is sacred, Vasudeva. The gods laugh. #emph[I] laugh. The universe that could have been dead matter is instead capable of comedy---and you want people to transcend it?

#section-heading[On Celebration]

#speaker[Indra] Your people will develop festivals. Colors thrown in the air. Dances around fires. Songs that shake the buildings. And the philosophers will say: this is for the masses. The advanced souls are beyond such things.

But the masses are right, and the advanced souls are missing the point.

A festival is not a distraction from spiritual life. A festival #emph[is] spiritual life---the community saying: we are alive, and this is worth celebrating, and we will not let the philosophers turn existence into a homework assignment.

When Rumi's Sufis spin, they are not performing a duty. They are celebrating---wildly, absurdly, with an abandon that would horrify your sthitaprajna. And in that spinning, they find God more directly than all the serene meditators combined.

I am not saying meditation is wrong. I am saying meditation is not the only door. And a philosophy that privileges stillness over motion, silence over song, transcendence over celebration---that philosophy is cutting itself off from half of what makes existence worth having.

#speaker[Krishna] You want me to say that dancing is equal to meditation?

#speaker[Indra] I want you to say that dancing is not #emph[inferior] to meditation. That the man who finds God in the dance is not a beginner on the path---he may have found a shortcut.
