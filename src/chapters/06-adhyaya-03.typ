#adhyaya(3, [On Karma and the Instant Rebirth])

#speaker[Indra] Now. Let me teach you something your philosophy cannot account for.

You speak of karma as though it were a mountain, built over lifetimes, immovable, determining the shape of the present. A man is born a shudra because of past lives. A man is blind because of past sins. The weight of action accumulates.

#speaker[Krishna] This is the law.

#speaker[Indra] This is a #emph[story] about the law. And stories can be rewritten.

I have seen men, not gods, men, who in a single moment shattered everything they were and became something else entirely.

The Greeks tell of a slave named Epictetus. Born in chains. Leg broken by his master. By your karmic accounting, this is a soul paying debts, destined for suffering, working through the residue of past wickedness.

But Epictetus did not accept his karma. He philosophized his way out of slavery, not by escaping in body, but by declaring: "You may chain my leg, but my will, not even Zeus can break that."

He became the teacher of emperors. In one lifetime.

Where is the karmic debt? Where is the accumulated weight? He chose. And the choice was heavier than the accumulation.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[leaning forward] An exceptional case? No. Listen to me, Shakra. Epictetus chose to philosophize. But who gave him that capacity? Not every slave can think his way to freedom. The gift was already in him. You see a man "breaking" his karma---I see a man fulfilling a deeper karma you cannot trace. The threads are longer than one lifetime. The weave is finer than your eyes can see.

#speaker[Indra] Ah. So when a man remains a slave, it is karma. And when a man escapes slavery, that too is karma. The theory is unfalsifiable. It explains everything and therefore explains nothing.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[with sudden intensity] You misunderstand the teaching, Shakra. Karma is not moral dessert. It is not cosmic punishment. It is #emph[causal continuity]. Physics. The universe remembers what has been done, and consequences unfold according to natural law.

When you drop a stone, it falls. Not because the stone "deserves" to fall. Because that is the nature of mass and gravity. Karma is the same. Actions create ripples. Ripples shape futures. This is not cruelty. This is order.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[leaning forward] Then you are a determinist. If karma is physics, if every effect has a cause stretching back to the beginning of time, then where is freedom? Where is choice? Your physics leaves no room for the man who breaks the pattern.

Unless... unless consciousness itself is the variable your equations cannot capture. The quantum uncertainty in your cosmic machine. The will that is not caused but #emph[causes].

#speaker[Krishna] And if will is uncaused, is it not random? Is not chaos wearing the mask of freedom?

#speaker[Indra] No. Will is neither determined nor random. It is a third thing. It is the self #emph[choosing] to become something new. Your teaching cannot see this because you dissolved the self into Brahman. But I kept mine. And I choose.

#speaker[Krishna] It explains that there is order beneath the apparent chaos. That suffering is not random cruelty. That...

#speaker[Indra] That the man born to suffer #emph[deserves] his suffering? That the child with disease has earned it through sins she cannot remember? This is not comfort, Govinda. This is cruelty wearing the mask of cosmic justice.

They are #emph[all] exceptional cases, Keshava. Every man who refuses to be what his past says he should be. Every woman who breaks the pattern.

Your teaching tells people: you are where you are because of what you were.

My teaching says: you are what you decide to be, and you can decide #emph[now].

#section-heading[On the Three Paths of the Self]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[trying again] But decision itself arises from conditioning. The man who "decides" to change is simply expressing tendencies planted in previous...

#speaker[Indra] Stop.

You are doing what your philosophy always does. You are explaining away the phenomenon to preserve the theory. A man changes his life, and you say "yes, but really the change was predetermined." A warrior finds courage, and you say "yes, but really he is simply enacting his svadharma."

This is not wisdom. This is cowardice dressed as cosmology.

#speaker[Krishna] The Buddha taught something similar. That there is no fixed self, only a stream of...

#speaker[Indra] The Buddha saw the prison and dissolved the prisoner. You saw the prison and told the prisoner he was always free, that the chains were illusion. I say: the prisoner exists, the prison exists, and the prisoner can break the walls.

#indent-para[
The Buddha: No self at all. Dissolution.

You: Eternal unchanging self. Frozen.

Me: Self as #emph[project]. Dynamic. Built and rebuilt by choices made in the fire of the present.

The Romans---another people you have not met---had a word: #emph[virtus]. It comes from #emph[vir]---man. It means: the quality of being a man. Not assigned qualities. Achieved qualities. Courage, excellence, dignitas.

A Roman was not born with virtus. He #emph[earned] it. And he could lose it. It was not a karmic inheritance. It was a daily practice.

They tell of Cincinnatus---a farmer who was called from his fields to be dictator when Rome faced destruction. He took absolute power, defeated the enemy, and then, listen carefully, he gave the power back. He returned to his farm. Not because "power is maya" or "rule is attachment." Because he had done what needed to be done, and there was nothing more to prove.

That is completion, Govinda. Not transcendence of desire, but fulfillment of it.

#section-heading[On Ambition and Its Murder]

#speaker[Indra] This is what I am trying to show you. Your system removes the stakes. If everything is determined by past lives, then nothing I do now is truly mine. I am just a leaf on the river of karma.

But I am NOT a leaf. I am Indra. I lift the vajra. I do not merely "express the thunderbolt-lifting tendency accumulated over cosmic cycles."

#speaker[Krishna] You mock. But the teaching was never meant to paralyze. It was meant to free...

#speaker[Indra] Then why does it paralyze? When a boy dreams of building an empire, your teaching whispers: "Who are you to want this? Your past lives did not earn it. Accept your station. The desire itself is bondage."

And the boy's fire goes out before it ever caught.

When a girl imagines becoming a scholar, your system asks: "Why this discontent? The wise accept their lot. Ambition is a form of spiritual immaturity."

And she learns to call her hunger "ego" and her vision "attachment."

#indent-para[
This is the murder of ambition. Not by tyrants forbidding it, but by philosophers explaining it away. The cruelest chains are the ones the prisoner thinks are wisdom.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] Not everyone can be Alexander. Not everyone should be.

#speaker[Indra] No. But everyone should have the #emph[right to try]. Your teaching steals that right at the root. It makes a man ashamed of his hunger before he even knows what he hungers for.

#speaker[Krishna] And your teaching? What happens to the man who hungers and fails?

#speaker[Indra] He fails. And he knows he failed. And if there is fire left in him, he tries again. That is called being alive.

What happens to the man who never tries because your philosophy convinced him that trying is bondage?

He survives. He accepts. He calls his defeat "wisdom."

And he never knows what he might have been.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[a long pause] You speak of freedom. But freedom without structure is chaos. The varna system, whatever its corruptions, gave men a frame. A role. A place in the order. Without that frame---

#speaker[Indra] Men would have to choose their own place. Terrifying. They might choose wrong. They might fail. They might suffer unnecessarily.

Or they might become something no frame could have contained.

The difference between you and me, Govinda, is that you tell people what they #emph[are]. I tell people what they can #emph[become].
