#adhyaya(9, [On Power and the Responsibility of the Strong])

#speaker[Indra] One final teaching. One I suspect you will resist.

Let us speak of power.

You were a king, Keshava. An advisor to kings. You moved armies, made alliances, broke them when necessary. You understood power.

But your teaching does not honor power. It treats power as a burden---a karmic obligation to be discharged without attachment. The ideal king in your philosophy is not one who revels in his capacity to shape the world, but one who rules dutifully, waiting for liberation.

#speaker[Krishna] Power corrupts. This is observable.

#speaker[Indra] Power corrupts when it is held shamefully. When the powerful man is taught that his power is spiritually suspect---that he should be embarrassed by his strength---then his power goes underground. It becomes manipulation instead of command. Scheming instead of ruling.

The Greeks again had clarity here. They distinguished between the tyrant and the king. The tyrant rules through fear and deception. The king rules through excellence---arete so visible that others willingly follow.

A man who owns his power can be held accountable for it. A man who pretends he has no power---who says "I am merely an instrument of dharma"---is far more dangerous.

#speaker[Krishna] Your Greeks and Romans built empires on slavery.

#speaker[Indra] Yes. And your Bharata built kingdoms on caste. Every civilization has its sins. The question is whether the philosophy helps you see the sins or helps you hide from them.

Your philosophy, Govinda, is excellent for hiding. "It's all karma. They're working out past debts. Who am I to interfere with the cosmic order?"

A philosophy that honors power---that says, "You are strong, and with strength comes the obligation to protect the weak"---that philosophy can be challenged. It sets up a standard the powerful can fail to meet.

A philosophy that dissolves power---that says strength and weakness are maya, all is one---that philosophy cannot be challenged. It allows anything.

#section-heading[On the Legitimate Pursuit of Power]

#speaker[Indra] Let me be clear. I am not saying power should be sought for its own sake, like a miser hoarding gold.

I am saying that a man who has the capacity to shape the world should embrace that capacity. He should seek more of it---not to dominate, but to accomplish.

The Persians understood this. Their emperor was called the King of Kings---not from mere vanity, but because he held himself to the standard of excellence that title implied. He was meant to be the best of all kings. And if he wasn't, he had failed his own name.

Your teaching produces kings who go through the motions. Who rule because their birth requires it, not because they burn to build something. Who administer rather than create.

And administration, Vasudeva, is not enough. Administration preserves. It does not transform.

The ages to come will require transformation. Your Bharata will face peoples who want things---land, trade, dominance---and your philosopher-kings will be helpless against them. Because the peoples who want things will out-work, out-fight, and out-build the peoples who have been taught that wanting is attachment.

This is not a prediction. This is a certainty. I have seen it.
