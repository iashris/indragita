#adhyaya(9, [On Power and the Responsibility of the Strong])

#speaker[Indra] One final teaching. One I suspect you will resist.

Let us speak of power.

You were a king, Keshava. An advisor to kings. You moved armies, made alliances, broke them when necessary. You understood power.

But your teaching does not honor power. It treats power as a burden---a karmic obligation to be discharged without attachment. The ideal king in your philosophy is not one who revels in his capacity to shape the world, but one who rules dutifully, waiting for liberation.

#speaker[Krishna] Power corrupts. This is observable.

#speaker[Indra] Power corrupts when it is held shamefully. When the powerful man is taught that his power is spiritually suspect---that he should be embarrassed by his strength---then his power goes underground. It becomes manipulation instead of command. Scheming instead of ruling.

The Greeks again had clarity here. They distinguished between the tyrant and the king. The tyrant rules through fear and deception. The king rules through excellence---arete so visible that others willingly follow.

A man who owns his power can be held accountable for it. A man who pretends he has no power---who says "I am merely an instrument of dharma"---is far more dangerous.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[sharply] Your peoples who "want things"---what do they want, Shakra? The Greeks wanted glory and built it on the backs of slaves. The Romans wanted order and crucified anyone who challenged it. The Arabs will want territory and put the sword to the unbeliever. Is this what you want my Bharata to become? Conquerors with clean consciences?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[meeting his gaze] I want them to be capable of conquest---and then to choose wisely how to use that capacity. The man who CAN conquer but chooses mercy is noble. The man who CANNOT conquer and calls his weakness "philosophy" is a slave pretending to be a saint.

Your philosophy, Govinda, is excellent for hiding. "It's all karma. They're working out past debts. Who am I to interfere with the cosmic order?"

A philosophy that honors power---that says, "You are strong, and with strength comes the obligation to protect the weak"---that philosophy can be challenged. It sets up a standard the powerful can fail to meet.

A philosophy that dissolves power---that says strength and weakness are maya, all is one---that philosophy cannot be challenged. It allows anything.

#section-heading[On Fire and Engine]

#speaker[Indra] Let me be clear about what I am asking for.

I am not asking you to unleash chaos. A fire without a hearth burns the house down.

But a hearth without fire is just cold stone.

#indent-para[
Fire without Engine---raw vitality, pure hunger---burns itself out. This is the warlord who conquers and cannot rule, the artist who creates one masterpiece and destroys himself, the lover who loves so hard he cannot function.

Engine without Fire---pure structure, empty discipline---stagnates. This is your administrator-king who preserves what was built but cannot build. Your philosopher who explains the world but cannot change it. Your civilization that survives but does not live.

What I want is Fire inside the Engine. The hunger of the outsider combined with the discipline of the builder. The vitality of the barbarian wielded with the precision of the emperor.
]

#speaker[Krishna] And you think my teaching prevents this?

#speaker[Indra] I think your teaching makes men ashamed of the fire. And a man who is ashamed of his own hunger will never build an engine worthy of it.

#section-heading[On Clean Roads and Two Kinds of Excellence]

#speaker[Indra] There are two kinds of cleanliness, Govinda.

The first is the priest's purity. Defensive. Fear-based. "Don't touch me, I might be polluted. Don't let the wrong person enter, they might contaminate the temple. Keep the low ones low, the high ones high, the order undisturbed."

The second is the king's excellence. Offensive. Pride-based. "This is my domain and it will be perfect. Not because I fear pollution---but because I demand that what is mine reflects what I am."

#indent-para[
The first kind of cleanliness produces caste. Untouchability. A culture where no one will clean the gutter because cleaning is polluting.

The second kind of cleanliness produces empires. Cities that shine. Roads that last a thousand years.

Your teaching, misapplied, produced the first. I want the second.
]

#speaker[Krishna] You want greatness. But greatness requires---

#speaker[Indra] Greatness requires men who want their domain to be perfect because it is #emph[theirs]. Not because dharma requires it. Not because karma will punish neglect. Because pride---the thing you call ego---cannot bear imperfection in what it has claimed.

#section-heading[On What Is Coming]

#speaker[Indra] Let me tell you what I have seen.

Men from the mountains and the desert will ride into your temples. They will want things your philosophers cannot understand. Land. Tribute. Submission.

And your Brahmins will say: "It is karma. It is the will of the cosmos. We must accept."

They will philosophize their defeat instead of fighting it. They will be so busy explaining WHY they lost that they will forget to win.

#indent-para[
I have seen what happens to peoples who lose the will to power. They become wise. And then they become weak. And then they become enslaved. And then they become forgotten.
]

Your teaching produces kings who go through the motions. Who rule because their birth requires it, not because they burn to build something. Who administer rather than create.

And administration, Vasudeva, is not enough. Administration preserves. It does not transform.

The ages to come will require transformation. Your Bharata will face peoples who want things---land, trade, dominance---and your philosopher-kings will be helpless against them. Because the peoples who want things will out-work, out-fight, and out-build the peoples who have been taught that wanting is attachment.

This is not a prediction. This is a certainty.

I have seen it.
