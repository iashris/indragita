#adhyaya(10, [The Question])

#action[A long silence. The sun has moved. The sea has changed color.]

#speaker[Krishna] You have spoken well, Sahasraksha.#footnote[Sahasraksha: "Thousand-eyed one," an epithet of Indra.] Better than I expected from one who sends storms against cowherds.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[almost gently] You embarrassed me that day. In front of the three worlds. A child lifting a mountain against the king of heaven.

#speaker[Krishna] And yet you're here teaching me. Not destroying me.

#speaker[Indra] If I had come to destroy you, I would have come differently.

I am here because I see what is coming. Your Bharata will meet other civilizations---peoples who did not grow up on your teaching. And those people will want things. They will want land, trade, conquest, dominance. They will not be calmed by talk of maya. They will not be defeated by equanimity.

And your philosophers will be helpless. They will say "why do these mlecchas strive so hard? Do they not know it is all illusion?" And while they are saying this, the mlecchas will be winning.

I do not want this for your people.

#speaker[Krishna] Why do you care?

#speaker[Indra] Because I am Indra. Because I love those who call on me. Because I still remember the yajna of your ancestors, when they sang to me without irony, when they asked for victory and cattle and sons and #emph[meant] it.

I want that spirit back. Not for my glory---I am old enough to be beyond that. But because I have seen what happens to peoples who lose it.

#indent-para[
They become wise. And then they become weak. And then they become enslaved. And then they become forgotten.

I will not watch this happen while the soma is still wet on my lips.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[standing, facing the sea] You want me to renounce my teaching?

#speaker[Indra] I want you to #emph[complicate] it. To say: detachment is one path, for some temperaments, at some stages of life. But it is not THE path. It is not higher. It is not the goal.

The householder who loves his wife fiercely is not lower than the sannyasin who has transcended love.

The king who wants his kingdom to prosper is not less evolved than the sage who sees all outcomes as equal.

The warrior who hates his enemy and wants to destroy him is not spiritually inferior to the one who kills without hatred.

These are different ways of being human. And you have ranked them. You have put the detached above the attached, the cool above the passionate, the transcendent above the engaged.

I am asking you to remove the ranking.

#speaker[Krishna] And if I cannot?

#speaker[Indra] Then your teaching will do what it has already begun to do. It will produce saints---rare. And it will produce hypocrites---common. And the hypocrites will cloak themselves in the saints' words, and your civilization will slowly, beautifully, sink into a kind of sophisticated helplessness.

And other peoples---hungrier, less philosophical, less wise---will eat it alive.

#action[The sound of the sea. A bird calls.]

#speaker[Krishna] The hunter is coming.

#speaker[Indra] I know.

#speaker[Krishna] I could avoid him. Even now.

#speaker[Indra] But you won't.

#speaker[Krishna] No. I have seen this death. It is mine.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[standing] Then let me ask you one last thing.

Are you going toward that arrow because it is your karma, your destined exit, the fruit you must not resist?

Or are you going toward it because you #emph[choose] death now, here, at the end of your era, as a statement---as the closing act of a life you authored?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[long pause] I don't know anymore.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[placing a hand on his shoulder] That is the most honest thing you've said.

When you know, you'll know whether you lived as a sage or as a man.

I hope it's the second.

#action[Indra walks back toward the forest. At the edge, he turns.]

#speaker[Indra] The teaching I've given you---it has no name yet. Give it one.

#speaker[Krishna] Indragita.

#speaker[Indra] Good. Let them read it alongside yours. Let them choose.

#action[He disappears into the trees. Moments later, the thunder rolls, far away, as if laughing.]

#action[Krishna waits for the arrow.]
