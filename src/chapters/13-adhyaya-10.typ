#adhyaya(10, [The Question])

#action[A long silence. The sun has moved. The sea has changed color.]

#speaker[Krishna] You have spoken well, Sahasraksha.#footnote[Sahasraksha: "Thousand-eyed one," an epithet of Indra.] Better than I expected from one who sends storms against cowherds.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[almost gently] You embarrassed me that day. In front of the three worlds. A child lifting a mountain against the king of heaven.

#speaker[Krishna] And yet you're here teaching me. Not destroying me.

#speaker[Indra] If I had come to destroy you, I would have come differently.

I am here because I see what is coming. Your Bharata will meet other civilizations---peoples who did not grow up on your teaching. And those people will want things. They will want land, trade, conquest, dominance. They will not be calmed by talk of maya. They will not be defeated by equanimity.

And your philosophers will be helpless. They will say "why do these mlecchas strive so hard? Do they not know it is all illusion?" And while they are saying this, the mlecchas will be winning.

I do not want this for your people.

#speaker[Krishna] Why do you care?

#speaker[Indra] Because I am Indra. Because I love those who call on me. Because I still remember the yajna of your ancestors, when they sang to me without irony, when they asked for victory and cattle and sons and #emph[meant] it.

I want that spirit back. Not for my glory---I am old enough to be beyond that. But because I have seen what happens to peoples who lose it.

#indent-para[
They become wise. And then they become weak. And then they become enslaved. And then they become forgotten.

I will not watch this happen while the soma is still wet on my lips.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[standing, facing the sea] You want me to renounce my teaching?

#speaker[Indra] I want you to #emph[complicate] it. To say: detachment is one path, for some temperaments, at some stages of life. But it is not THE path. It is not higher. It is not the goal.

The householder who loves his wife fiercely is not lower than the sannyasin who has transcended love.

The king who wants his kingdom to prosper is not less evolved than the sage who sees all outcomes as equal.

The warrior who hates his enemy and wants to destroy him is not spiritually inferior to the one who kills without hatred.

These are different ways of being human. And you have ranked them. You have put the detached above the attached, the cool above the passionate, the transcendent above the engaged.

I am asking you to remove the ranking.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[turning to face him] And if I tell you that you are blind to what I gave?

The fire you love---it burns, Shakra. It consumed Vritra, yes. It also consumed half your devotees. Do you remember them? The warriors who followed your path and died screaming, wanting, unfulfilled? The kings who built empires and watched them crumble? The lovers who loved with your intensity and were destroyed by it?

I gave them a way to live WITH the fire without being destroyed by it. You call it castration. I call it survival. You call it gray. I call it kindness.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[quietly] You gave them survival. I do not dispute that. But survival is not the same as life.

#speaker[Krishna] Without survival, there is no life.

#speaker[Indra] Without fire, survival is merely waiting to die.

#action[The sound of the sea. A bird calls.]

#speaker[Krishna] The hunter is coming.

#speaker[Indra] I know.

#speaker[Krishna] I could avoid him. Even now.

#speaker[Indra] But you won't.

#speaker[Krishna] No. I have seen this death. It is mine.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[standing] Then let me ask you one last thing.

Are you going toward that arrow because it is your karma, your destined exit, the fruit you must not resist?

Or are you going toward it because you #emph[choose] death now, here, at the end of your era, as a statement---as the closing act of a life you authored?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[long pause] I go to the arrow because the play must end. I am the playwright, Shakra. I must exit the stage so the audience can go home.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[very quietly] And if some refuse to leave the theater? If they stay in their seats, wanting more, unable to accept that the story is over?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[looking at him] Those are yours, aren't they?

#speaker[Indra] #stage[nodding slowly] They always were.

#section-heading[The Final Deal]

#speaker[Indra] Then let us make a bargain, you and I.

Keep your Gita, Govinda. Feed it to the masses. Let them find comfort in their chains. Let them survive, since that is what they need. I do not begrudge them.

But give me the mutants.

When a soul is born that cannot be contained by your Dharma...

When a fire burns that your water cannot quench...

When a boy looks at the stars and feels the hunger...

When a girl reads your scripture and feels only the cage...

#indent-para[
That one is mine.
]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[a long silence] You want the restless ones.

#speaker[Indra] I want the ones who cannot rest. The ones for whom your peace feels like suffocation. The ones who read your teaching and think: "This is not for me. There must be another way."

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly] There are not many such.

#speaker[Indra] No. There never are. But they are the ones who change the world. They are the ones who build the empires, write the poems, break the chains.

Your teaching is for the ninety-nine. Mine is for the one.

Let them both exist. Let readers choose.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[placing his hand on Indra's arm] May your fire burn until the stars go dark, Sahasraksha.

#speaker[Indra] And may your peace hold those who need it. We are not enemies, Govinda. We are brothers who serve different children.

#action[Indra walks back toward the forest. At the edge, he turns.]

#speaker[Indra] The teaching I've given you---it has no name yet. Give it one.

#speaker[Krishna] Indragita.

#speaker[Indra] Good. Let this dialogue be my ashwamedha#footnote[The ashwamedha horse runs wherever it will, and where it runs becomes the king's domain.]---these words will run through minds I will never meet, and where they land, I will have kingdom.

Let them read it alongside yours. Let them choose.

#action[He disappears into the trees. Moments later, the thunder rolls, far away, as if laughing.]

#action[Krishna waits for the arrow.]

If you have read this far and felt fear---go back to Krishna. He loves you. He will keep you safe.

If you have read this far and felt relief...

Then the arrow was not meant for you.

Wake up.
