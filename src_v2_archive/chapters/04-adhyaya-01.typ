#adhyaya(1, [The Descent])

At the edge of Prabhasa, where the forest meets the sea, Krishna sat alone. The Yadavas had slain each other. The city of Dvaraka was sinking. The age was turning.

#indent-para[
He had known it would end this way. He had seen it, spoken it, allowed it.

The hunter's arrow would come soon. He was waiting for it the way one waits for a guest who is late but certain.

Instead, Indra came.
]

Not in thunder. Not with the host of Maruts. He came as a man comes to another man---walking out of the tree line, his footsteps making sound on the earth, his shadow falling in the ordinary way. Only his eyes held the storm.

#speaker[Indra] You taught the world to let go. And now you sit here, letting go. I want to know if it feels the way you promised it would.

#speaker[Krishna] You've come to gloat, Shakra? The one who sent storms against cowherds?

#speaker[Indra] I came to ask a question. I'll only stay if you can bear to answer it honestly.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[smiling] Honesty. You think I've been dishonest?

#speaker[Indra] I think you've been so clever that you've forgotten what honesty costs. You told Arjuna that the wise grieve neither for the living nor the dead. You told him the soul is eternal, the body is clothes, death is a change of garments.

#speaker[Krishna] This is true.

#speaker[Indra] And did Arjuna fight better for believing it? Or did he fight the way a man fights when he's been told it doesn't matter?

#speaker[Krishna] He fought. He won. The war ended.

#speaker[Indra] The war ended. Yes. I was there when Bhishma fell. I watched Arjuna's face. Do you know what I saw?

#speaker[Krishna] Tell me.

#speaker[Indra] Relief. Not victory. Not grief. Not even hatred fulfilled. Relief that it was over. That he could stop performing the thing you'd asked him to perform.

#speaker[Krishna] You misread him.

#speaker[Indra] I have killed more enemies than you have hairs on your body, Vasudeva. I know what a warrior's face looks like when he wins. That was not it.

#speaker[Krishna] What would you have had me teach him? To slaughter his grandfather with joy? To laugh while cutting down his teachers?

#speaker[Indra] I would have had you teach him to #emph[want] his victory. To own it. To say: I am killing Bhishma because I choose to, because the throne matters to me, because my brothers matter to me, because I refuse to live as a beggar when I was born a prince.

#speaker[Krishna] And the sin of killing?

#speaker[Indra] Let him carry it! Let him feel its weight! A man who kills and feels nothing is not liberated---he is broken. You taught him to pre-forgive himself by pretending he wasn't really the one doing it. That Time was the killer. That the selves were already dead.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quieter now] It was a mercy.

#speaker[Indra] It was a trick. And tricks produce tricksters. Tell me---in the ages since Kurukshetra, what has your teaching made? Saints? Or men who speak like saints while acting like wolves, and feel no conflict because they've learned your art of detachment?

#speaker[Krishna] You want me to defend every misuse of wisdom? Should fire apologize because men burn villages?

#speaker[Indra] No. Fire should not apologize. But you are not fire. You chose these words. You saw what they would become. You're the one who knows past, present, future---did you not see the hypocrisy your teaching would breed?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[long pause] I saw... that men needed a way to act in an impure world without being paralyzed by that impurity.

#speaker[Indra] And I am telling you there is another way. A way that does not require a man to lie to himself about what he wants and what he's doing. I am telling you there is a path of sincerity, and it is harder than your path, but it does not rot from within.

#speaker[Krishna] Then teach me, King of Heaven. You who lost your worshippers to a cowherd's rebellion. You whose throne shakes whenever a mortal's austerities grow too strong. Teach me about strength.

#speaker[Indra] #stage[sits down across from him] I will. Because I have done what you have never done. I have wanted things, and failed to get them, and remained Indra. I did not console myself by saying I never really wanted them. I did not say desire is the enemy. I lost, and I wanted, and I kept wanting, and I tried again.

That is the teaching.
