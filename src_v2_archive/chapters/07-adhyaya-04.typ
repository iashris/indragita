#adhyaya(4, [On Sincerity and the Culture of Hiding])

#speaker[Indra] Let us speak now of what your teaching does to a society over time.

In the beginning, a few great souls understand you truly. They achieve genuine detachment---not by lying about their desires, but by genuinely transcending them. Janaka. Perhaps Vyasa. A handful.

But the teaching spreads. And ordinary men hear: "Desire is bondage. Attachment is ignorance. The wise man acts without wanting the fruit."

Now---what does an ordinary man do with this teaching?

#speaker[Krishna] He practices. He refines. Over lifetimes, he approaches---

#speaker[Indra] No. I will tell you what he does.

He still wants. He wants wealth, status, pleasure, victory---all the things men want. But now he has been told that wanting is low. It is spiritually inferior. The wanting itself becomes a source of shame.

So he learns to hide his wanting. From others. From himself. He speaks the language of detachment while scheming underneath. He says "I am beyond outcomes" while angling for promotion. He says "All is Brahman" while cheating his neighbor.

#speaker[Krishna] This is misuse. Not the teaching itself.

#speaker[Indra] When every student misuses a teaching, the teaching is at fault.

The Greeks again---Aristotle saw this clearly. He said: we must study ethics not by looking at ideals, but by looking at what actually happens when people try to live by ideals.

What #emph[actually happens] when a culture tries to live by your Gita?

I will tell you what happens. Men become sophisticated hypocrites. They develop a public language of spirituality and a private language of appetite. The gap between word and deed becomes so normal that no one notices it. This is simply how things are.

And the worst part, Govinda---they lose the ability to even recognize sincerity when they see it. A man who says plainly "I want this, I will fight for it" is seen as crude. Unspiritual. Attached.

Meanwhile, the "spiritual" man plots and manipulates while speaking of non-attachment.

Which one is truly corrupt?

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[standing now] You are describing fallen men. Not the teaching.

#speaker[Indra] I am describing the men the teaching produces.

#section-heading[On Fearless Speech]

Let me ask you this. In the lands of the Greeks, when a man wants something, he says so. If a philosopher thinks another philosopher is wrong, he stands up in the agora and says "You are wrong, and here is why." They have a word for this: #emph[parrhesia]. Fearless speech. The obligation to speak truth plainly, even to power.

In the lands your teaching shapes, what happens? A man says "I have no opinion, I am merely a servant of dharma." Or "Who am I to say? All perspectives contain truth." Or "I will meditate on this"---meaning, I will avoid the conflict.

You have created a culture afraid of assertion. Afraid of clarity. Afraid of saying: I think this, I want this, I will fight for this.

And you call it spiritual advancement.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] There is violence in assertion. War follows from want.

#speaker[Indra] War follows from life, Vasudeva. The question is not whether to fight---it is whether to fight cleanly, with your reasons spoken aloud, or to fight through manipulation while pretending you are above the fight.

Your Kauravas and Pandavas---did your teaching prevent their war? Or did it merely allow them to spiritualize their slaughter?

#section-heading[On Individuality]

#speaker[Indra] And there is another poison in your philosophy. The dissolution of the individual.

You teach that the atman is the same in all beings. That the wise man sees no difference between a brahmin and a dog. That all distinctions are maya.

#speaker[Krishna] This is the highest truth.

#speaker[Indra] It is a truth that destroys individual excellence.

If I am the same as everyone, why should I strive to be #emph[more] than I am? Why should I develop my particular gifts, cultivate my particular vision, leave my particular mark? It's all the same Brahman anyway.

The Greeks celebrated #emph[arete]---the excellence specific to a thing. The arete of a horse is different from the arete of a poet. And a man's greatness lies in discovering and perfecting his own particular excellence.

Your teaching flattens this. In the name of cosmic unity, you destroy the individual---the only locus where anything actually happens, where choices are made, where beauty is created.

A civilization of people who believe they are all the same Brahman is a civilization where no one feels the obligation to be #emph[exceptional]. Why bother? It's all illusion anyway.

#speaker[Krishna] You mistake the teaching. The wise man sees unity but still acts---

#speaker[Indra] The wise man acts #emph[dutifully]. Without passion. Without the fire that makes a man do more than he must.

I would rather have a civilization of ambitious individuals who believe their souls are unique and their accomplishments matter than a civilization of wise men who know it's all maya and therefore give exactly as much effort as dharma requires and not one ounce more.
