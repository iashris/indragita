#adhyaya(5, [On Love, Loss, and the Nature of Consciousness])

#speaker[Indra] Now I will speak of what angers me most.

#speaker[Krishna] Anger is---

#speaker[Indra] Yes, yes. Anger is a modification of the mind. It arises from attachment to outcome. The wise man lets it pass like a cloud.

I do not want to let it pass.

#indent-para[
I want to tell you about love.

Your devotees love you. Radha loved you---or so the songs will say. And how did you love her in return?
]

#speaker[Krishna] With divine love. Beyond mortal attachment. The love that sees the eternal in---

#speaker[Indra] You left her.

#speaker[Krishna] I had duties. Mathura called. Karma required---

#speaker[Indra] You left her.

And when you loved your son, Pradyumna---did you love him as a father? Or as a soul recognizing another soul temporarily housed in your family, soon to move on, attachment to be transcended?

#speaker[Krishna] ...

#speaker[Indra] Your silence tells me what I need to know.

#section-heading[On Fierce Attachment]

There is another way to love. The Greeks wrote of it---eros and philia and storge. The Persians sang of it---the fire that burns but does not consume. The Arabs will write poetry about it that will make men weep a thousand years from now.

And the teaching at the core of all of it is: #emph[you can lose what you love, and that is why love matters].

The risk is not a flaw. The risk is the point. When I love knowing that I can lose, I love fully. When I love while telling myself "this is all maya, the soul is eternal, loss is illusion"---I have hedged. I have protected myself. And in protecting myself, I have made my love smaller.

#speaker[Krishna] You would have people suffer? Attachment brings suffering. This is observable. The mother who loses her child---

#speaker[Indra] Should suffer. Her suffering is not a mistake. It is the proof that her love was real.

What you offer is a kind of emotional insurance. "Love, but not too much. Care, but keep a part of yourself back. That way, when loss comes, you'll be ready."

And people take your insurance. And their loves become tepid. Their families become arrangements. Their friendships become networks. Always a part held back. Always the teaching whispering: don't commit fully, you'll only be hurt.

A Sufi will write: #emph["Whoever knows the power of the dance dwells in God, because he knows that love kills."]

Love kills. Not "love gently releases you from the illusion of separate selfhood." KILLS.

That is the real teaching. To love so completely that if the beloved is torn from you, part of you dies.

And your philosophy calls this bondage. I call it being alive.

#section-heading[On the Nature of Love]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[slowly] You speak of love as if it were simple. But what #emph[is] love, Shakra? Is it not just chemistry? Neurons firing? An evolutionary trick to ensure reproduction?

#speaker[Indra] Now you sound like the materialists of future ages. Let me tell you what love actually is.

We are consciousness. You, me, the cowherds you protected, the ants beneath this tree---all of us are consciousness experiencing itself through different forms. Machines of awareness, if you will.

And love is what happens when one consciousness machine recognizes another and says: #emph[I want to resonate with you. I want to know you. I want our frequencies to align.]

This is not metaphor. This is the deepest physics of existence. Consciousness seeks consciousness. Awareness reaches toward awareness. The universe is not dead matter occasionally producing mind---it is mind occasionally condensing into matter.

And when two minds find each other---truly find each other---something is created that neither could create alone. A harmony. A new pattern in the fabric of existence.

#speaker[Krishna] And when they lose each other?

#speaker[Indra] Then the pattern tears. And it should hurt. The pain is information. It tells you: something real was here, and now it's gone.

Your teaching tries to make the pain disappear by denying the reality of the connection. "It was maya. The self is eternal. Nothing was really lost."

But something WAS lost. A unique resonance. An unrepeatable harmony. And a philosophy that cannot grieve cannot truly love.

#section-heading[On the Many Forms of Love]

#speaker[Indra] And Keshava---this resonance takes many forms.

The Greeks loved men and women both. Sappho wrote of women loving women with a fire that burned through centuries. Achilles and Patroclus---the poets cannot decide if they were friends or lovers, because in the Greek understanding the distinction barely mattered. Love was love. Resonance was resonance.

#speaker[Krishna] My people have known this too. The third nature. Shikhandi. The tales speak of---

#speaker[Indra] Your tales speak of it, and then your pundits bury it. They say: this was a special case. An exception. A past-life complication.

But it is not an exception. Consciousness does not care what body it wears when it reaches toward another consciousness. The machine of awareness has no gender until it is embodied. And even then, the yearning for resonance does not check the body's configuration before it strikes.

A man who loves a man is not confused. He has simply found the consciousness that harmonizes with his own. A woman who loves a woman is not aberrant. She has simply found her frequency.

Your teaching, when misapplied, makes people ashamed of these resonances. It tells them: this is attachment, this is maya, this is a distraction from the true goal of liberation.

But liberation that requires you to deny love is not liberation. It is amputation.

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[quietly] I never taught that love between---

#speaker[Indra] You taught that all love is a lesser path. That bhakti is for those not ready for jnana. That attachment of any kind is bondage.

And your followers heard this and made hierarchies. This love is acceptable, that love is perverse. This attachment is devotion, that attachment is sin.

The teaching that all is one became the justification for excluding those whose oneness looked different.

I am not asking you to change your philosophy. I am asking you to see what it enables when small men wield it.
