#adhyaya(7, [On Death, Beauty, and the Shape of a Life])

#speaker[Indra] We have spoken of life. Now let us speak of death.

You taught Arjuna that death is nothing---a change of clothes, a passage, a return to the eternal. The warrior need not fear death because the self cannot die.

#speaker[Krishna] This is true.

#speaker[Indra] And what kind of death does this teaching produce?

I will tell you. It produces deaths that are accepted rather than met. Surrendered to rather than wrestled. Your people will go gently---too gently---into a darkness they have been trained to see as illusion.

The Greeks had a different relationship with death. They knew it was real. They knew it ended something. And so they asked: #emph[how should a life be shaped so that its ending has meaning?]

They called this #emph[kalos thanatos]---the beautiful death.#footnote[Greek: _kalos_ (beautiful) + _thanatos_ (death). The concept of dying nobly, with one's life's work complete.] Not a death that transcends the body, but a death that completes a life. Socrates drinking the hemlock while teaching. The Spartans at Thermopylae. Deaths that were, in some sense, #emph[composed].

#speaker[Krishna] And you think this is superior? Men clinging to glory even as they die?

#speaker[Indra] I think it is more honest.

When the Stoics faced death---those Romans who inherited Greek wisdom---they did not say "death is illusion." They said: "Death is real, and I will meet it as I have tried to live---with courage, with dignity, with my accounts in order."

Marcus Aurelius, an emperor, wrote in his private journal: "Do not act as if you had ten thousand years to live. Death hangs over you. While you live, while it is in your power, be good."

#emph[While you live]. Because this is what matters. Not the eternal atman, unchanged by death. This life. This body. This brief window of consciousness in which you can make choices.

#speaker[Krishna] And when the window closes?

#speaker[Indra] Then it closes. And the question becomes: what did you do with it?

You will wait for Jara's arrow in equanimity. You will die as you taught---without attachment, without resistance, passing into whatever comes next with the serenity of one who knew it was all maya anyway.

I will die differently, when my time comes. I will die wanting. I will die with unfinished projects and unfulfilled desires and things I still meant to do. And my dying will not be a release---it will be a tearing.

This is not inferior. This is the price of having lived.

#section-heading[On Making Beautiful Things]

#speaker[Indra] And while we live, Keshava---while we have bodies and time---there is the matter of beauty.

Your philosophy dismisses aesthetics. Art is maya. Music is distraction. The beautiful temple is no different from the pile of rubble it will become. All is Brahman, so why does the form matter?

But form matters. The shape of things matters. The Greeks knew this---they built not just to shelter but to awe. The Persians knew this---their gardens were not just plants but poetry made physical.

And your own ancestors knew this. The Vedic hymns are not just meaning---they are #emph[sound]. The meters matter. The cadences matter. The rishis who composed them were not just philosophers; they were artists.

Beauty is not a distraction from truth. Beauty is truth rendered sensible. When you make something beautiful, you are participating in rta---the cosmic order, the pattern that holds existence together.

A man who dismisses beauty because "it's all illusion anyway" has missed something essential. He has failed to notice that illusion, if it is illusion, is suspiciously well-designed.

#speaker[Krishna] You speak as if I do not appreciate beauty. I played the flute. The gopis danced. Vrindavan was---

#speaker[Indra] Vrindavan was your youth. And then you grew up, went to Mathura, gave discourses on transcendence, and let the dancing become a memory.

The gopis did not want transcendence, Keshava. They wanted #emph[you]. And you gave them philosophy instead.
