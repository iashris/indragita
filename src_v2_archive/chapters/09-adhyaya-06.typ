#adhyaya(6, [On Excellence and the Fruit of Action])

#speaker[Indra] One more teaching. The most practical. The one that will shape whether your Bharata rises or falls in the ages to come.

You told Arjuna: "You have a right to action, but not to the fruits of action."#footnote[Bhagavad Gita 2.47: _Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana._]

#speaker[Krishna] This is the heart of karma yoga.

#speaker[Indra] This is the heart of mediocrity.

Listen to me carefully.

A man sets out to build a temple. If he follows your teaching, he says: "I will labor, but I will not be attached to whether the temple is built or not. My dharma is the action, not the outcome."

Now tell me---will that man check his measurements twice? Will he argue with the architect when the design is flawed? Will he stay late into the night correcting errors? Will he fight for the temple's perfection?

#speaker[Krishna] If he is wise, he will do his duty without---

#speaker[Indra] He will do his duty. The minimum. What is required. Because anything more would be #emph[attachment to outcome]. Anything more would be desire for fruit.

But the man who #emph[wants] the temple to be magnificent? Who cares whether it stands for a thousand years? Who checks his measurements obsessively, not because it is his duty, but because the thought of a flaw #emph[pains] him?

That man will build a temple that lasts.

Excellence requires attachment. Excellence requires caring about the fruit. Excellence requires the willingness to be destroyed by failure---not to stand above it, serene, but to let it gut you.

The Greeks built the Parthenon because they wanted glory. Not duty. Glory. The thing you dismiss as ego-attachment.

And the Parthenon still stands.

#section-heading[On the Warrior Spirit]

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[attempting a counter] Your Greeks also fell. Your Romans fell. All empires of ambition and glory fall.

#speaker[Indra] Yes. And while they stood, they #emph[stood]. They made things that will be remembered when your Kali Yuga has ground all memory to dust.

Let me ask you: would you rather have a civilization that burns bright for three centuries and leaves behind philosophy, architecture, poetry, law---or one that persists in gray mediocrity for a thousand years, everyone performing their dharma, no one reaching too high, no one risking failure?

#speaker[Krishna] That is not the choice.

#speaker[Indra] It is exactly the choice. And your teaching pushes toward the second.

Not because you intend it. But because when you tell people that ambition is attachment, that desire for greatness is ego, that the wise man cares nothing for success or failure---you remove the fuel.

The fuel is not holy. But it is necessary.

#section-heading[On Righteous Anger]

#speaker[Indra] And let me tell you something else about the fuel.

Anger.

You teach that anger is a vrtti---a fluctuation of the mind to be stilled. The wise man does not let anger move him. He acts from duty, not from passion.

But some of the greatest things ever built were built in anger. Some of the worst injustices were corrected by men and women who #emph[refused] to let their anger pass like a cloud.

When the Arabs speak of jihad as striving, they understand this. The struggle against your own mediocrity is fueled by a holy dissatisfaction---an anger at the gap between what you are and what you could be.

The Jews have a concept---#emph[tikkun olam]---repairing the world.#footnote[Hebrew: literally "repair of the world." A concept in Judaism about humanity's shared responsibility to heal and transform the world.] It requires looking at the world's brokenness and being #emph[angry] that it is broken. Not equanimous. Not serene. Angry enough to fix it.

Your sthitaprajna, watching injustice with equanimity, waiting for karma to sort it out---he is not enlightened. He is complicit.

#speaker[Krishna] Anger clouds judgment. History is full of---

#speaker[Indra] History is full of anger misused. Also history is full of anger well-used. The question is not whether to feel anger but whether to aim it rightly.

A bow can kill an innocent child or slay a demon. You do not solve this by destroying the bow. You solve it by training the archer.

Your teaching destroys the bow.
