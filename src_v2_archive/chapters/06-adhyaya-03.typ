#adhyaya(3, [On Karma and the Instant Rebirth])

#speaker[Indra] Now. Let me teach you something your philosophy cannot account for.

You speak of karma as though it were a mountain---built over lifetimes, immovable, determining the shape of the present. A man is born a shudra because of past lives. A man is blind because of past sins. The weight of action accumulates.

#speaker[Krishna] This is the law.

#speaker[Indra] This is a #emph[story] about the law. And stories can be rewritten.

I have seen men---not gods, men---who in a single moment shattered everything they were and became something else entirely.

The Greeks tell of a slave named Epictetus. Born in chains. Leg broken by his master. By your karmic accounting, this is a soul paying debts---destined for suffering, working through the residue of past wickedness.

But Epictetus did not accept his karma. He philosophized his way out of slavery---not by escaping in body, but by declaring: "You may chain my leg, but my will---not even Zeus can break that."

He became the teacher of emperors. In one lifetime.

Where is the karmic debt? Where is the accumulated weight? He chose---and the choice was heavier than the accumulation.

#speaker[Krishna] An exceptional case.

#speaker[Indra] They are #emph[all] exceptional cases, Keshava. Every man who refuses to be what his past says he should be. Every woman who breaks the pattern.

Your teaching tells people: you are where you are because of what you were.

My teaching says: you are what you decide to be, and you can decide #emph[now].

#speaker[Krishna] #stage[trying again] But decision itself arises from conditioning. The man who "decides" to change is simply expressing tendencies planted in previous---

#speaker[Indra] Stop.

You are doing what your philosophy always does. You are explaining away the phenomenon to preserve the theory. A man changes his life, and you say "yes, but really the change was predetermined." A warrior finds courage, and you say "yes, but really he is simply enacting his svadharma."

This is not wisdom. This is cowardice dressed as cosmology.

The Romans---another people you have not met---had a word: #emph[virtus]. It comes from #emph[vir]---man. It means: the quality of being a man. Not assigned qualities. Achieved qualities. Courage, excellence, dignitas.

A Roman was not born with virtus. He #emph[earned] it. And he could lose it. It was not a karmic inheritance---it was a daily practice.

This is what I am trying to show you. Your system removes the stakes. If everything is determined by past lives, then nothing I do now is truly mine. I am just a leaf on the river of karma.

But I am NOT a leaf. I am Indra. I lift the vajra---I do not merely "express the thunderbolt-lifting tendency accumulated over cosmic cycles."

#speaker[Krishna] The Buddha taught something similar. That there is no fixed self, only a stream of---

#speaker[Indra] The Buddha went too far in the other direction. He dissolved the self entirely. I am not saying there is no self---I am saying the self is not a prison. It is a project. You build it. You can rebuild it.

The difference between you and me, Govinda, is that you tell people what they #emph[are]. I tell people what they can #emph[become].
